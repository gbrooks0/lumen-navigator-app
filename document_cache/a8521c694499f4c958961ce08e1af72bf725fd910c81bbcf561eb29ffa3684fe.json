    "page_content": "7 \nIntroduction\nNothing is more important than children’s welfare. Every child deserves to grow up in a \nsafe, stable, and loving home. Children who need help and protection deserve high quality \nand effective support. This requires individuals, agencies, and organisations to be clear \nabout their own and each other’s roles and responsibilities, and how they work together. \nIn this guidance, a child is defined as anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday. \n‘Children’ therefore means ‘children and young people’ throughout. The term practitioner \nis used in the guidance to refer to individuals who work with children and their families in \nany capacity, including a range of professionals, such as qualified social workers and \nthose who work for the statutory safeguarding partners or in education settings. \nWhilst it is parents and carers who have primary care for their children, local authorities, \nworking with partner organisations and agencies, have specific duties to safeguard and \npromote the welfare of all children in their area. The Children Act 1989 1 sets out specific \nduties to provide services to children in their area if they are in need and to undertake \nenquiries if they believe a child has suffered or is likely to suffer significant harm. The \nDirector of Children’s Services and Lead Member for Children’s Services in local \nauthorities are the key points of professional and political accountability, with \nresponsibility for the effective delivery of these functions. The Children Act 20042 placed a \nduty on the local authority to promote co-operation with partners and other agencies in \norder to improve the wellbeing of children in their area. It also placed duties on a range of \norganisations and individuals to ensure they too give sufficient regard to children in need \nof help and safeguarding. \nAmendments made by the Children and Social Work Act 2017 to the Children Act 2004\nstrengthened this already important relationship by placing new duties on the police, \nintegrated care boards (ICBs)3 and the local authority, as statutory safeguarding partners. \nSafeguarding partners are under a duty to make arrangements to work together, and with \nother partners locally including education providers and childcare settings, to safeguard \nand promote the welfare of all children in their area. \nSafeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is defined for the purposes of this \nguidance as:\n• providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems \nemerge\n1 Children Act 1989 \n2 Children Act 2004\n3 Statutory guidance for integrated care boards on executive lead roles\n",

As set out in the Children’s Social Care National Framework, the following \nprinciples apply here too: \n• children’s welfare is paramount\n• children’s wishes and feelings are sought, heard, and responded to\n• children’s social care works in partnership with whole families\n• children are raised by their families, with their family networks or in family \nenvironments wherever possible\n• local authorities work with other agencies to effectively identify and meet the needs \nof children, young people, and families \n• local authorities consider the economic and social circumstances impacting\nchildren, young people, and families\nA child-centred approach within a whole family focus\n12. A child-centred approach is fundamental to safeguarding and promoting the \nwelfare of every child. All practitioners should follow the principles of the Children Acts \n1989 and 2004. These Acts make clear that the welfare of children is paramount and that \nthey are best looked after within their families, with their parents playing a full part in their \nlives, unless compulsory intervention in family life is necessary. \n13.

In addition to practitioners shaping support around the needs of individual children,\nlocal organisations and agencies should have a clear understanding of the collective \nneeds of children locally when commissioning effective services. As part of that, ICBs are \nrequired to have executive lead roles for children, children with SEND and for \nsafeguarding (these could be individual roles or combined as part of one role). It is \nexpected that these executive leads will work with key partners across public health,\nsocial care, justice, and education to ensure the interests of those groups are met, \nincluding appropriate resources are allocated for the provision of services and maintaining \nan overview of the quality of services. As part of that process, the Director of Public \nHealth, informed by the relevant ICB Executive Leads, should ensure that the needs of \nchildren are a key part of the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) developed by the \nHealth and Wellbeing Board. Safeguarding partners should use this assessment to help \nthem understand the prevalence and contexts of need, including specific needs relating to \ndisabled children and those relating to abuse, neglect and exploitation, which in turn \nshould help shape services.\nPrinciples for working with parents and carers \n18. In the context of a child-centred approach, all practitioners should work in \npartnership with parents and carers as far as possible. Parents and carers need to \nunderstand what is happening, what they can expect from the help and support provided, \nwhat is expected of them and be supported to say what they think. This is particularly \nimportant when there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering, or is likely to \nsuffer, significant harm, whether the harm is from inside or outside the home including \nonline. Working collaboratively will mean parents and carers have the best chance of \nmaking changes, and practitioners can make fair and accurate decisions about how to \nsupport children and keep them safe. While collaborative relationships between \npractitioners and, parents and carers are important, the wishes and feelings of the child\nand what is in their best interest remain central to decision-making. Practitioners need to \nbe particularly skilled in engaging and working with parents and carers whom services \nhave found difficult to engage. Some examples may be parents and carers of disabled \nchildren, parents, and carers whose children are at risk of, or experiencing, harm from \noutside the home, fathers, and male carers, and those who are neurodivergent. \nPractitioners also need to recognise, engage, and work with parents and carers who are \nunwilling or unable to engage with services. Four principles underpin work with parents \nand carers: \n1) Effective partnership working with parents and carers happens when practitioners\nbuild strong, positive, trusting, and co-operative relationships by:\n",

They \nvalue their contributions, expertise and knowledge reflecting them in service design \nand continuously seek feedback from parents, carers, family networks, children, \nand local communities to inform service improvements. Practitioners use feedback\nfrom parents and carers to reflect on their own practice. \nExpectations for multi-agency working\n19. Strong multi-agency and multi-disciplinary working is vital to identifying and \nresponding to the needs of children and families. The following expectations have been \ndeveloped to underpin this multi-agency working. They apply to all agencies and \npractitioners involved in safeguarding and protecting children. Specifically, these include \npolice, local authorities, health services, probation services, youth offending services, \neducation providers and childcare settings, and voluntary and third sector \norganisations. The term practitioners used here refers to all those working in these \nservices and settings. \n20. The expectations are structured at three levels for strategic leaders, senior and \nmiddle managers, and direct practice. \n21. Strategic leaders may include Chief Executives of local authorities, Chief \nExecutives of ICBs, Chief Executives of NHS Trusts, Chief Constables, Police and Crime \nCommissioners, and Chief Executives of multi-academy trusts.\n",

In particular, the Data Protection Act 2018\nbalances the rights of the information subject (the individual whom the information is \nabout) and the possible need to share information about them.\nConsent is needed to share personal information \nNo, you do not need consent to share personal information. It is one way to comply \nwith the data protection legislation but not the only way. UK GDPR provides a number \nof bases for sharing personal information. It is not necessary to seek consent to share \ninformation for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of a child \nprovided that there is a lawful basis to process any personal information required. The \nlegal bases that may be appropriate for sharing data in these circumstances could be \n‘legal obligation’, or ‘public task’ which includes the performance of a task in the public \ninterest or the exercise of official authority. Each of the lawful bases under UK GDPR \nhas different requirements. It is good practice to be transparent and inform \nparents/carers that you are sharing information for these purposes and seek to work \ncooperatively with them, where it is safe to do so.\nPersonal information collected by one organisation/agency cannot be disclosed \nto another \nNo, this is not the case unless the information is to be used for a purpose incompatible \nwith the purpose for which it was originally collected. In the case of children in need, or \nchildren at risk of significant harm, it is difficult to foresee circumstances where \ninformation law would be a barrier to sharing personal information with other \npractitioners15. \n15 Practitioners looking to share information should consider which processing condition in the Data Protection Act 2018 is most \nappropriate for use in the particular circumstances of the case.

Although the geographical boundaries for the three safeguarding partners may \ndiffer in size, multi-agency safeguarding arrangements should be based on local authority \nareas. Arrangements can cover two or more local authority boundaries by agreement and \nwhere this is in place local authorities can agree to delegate their safeguarding duties to a \nsingle authority19. \n42. The geographical area of a local multi-agency safeguarding arrangement can be \nchanged over time. Where changes are proposed, these should be agreed by all \nsafeguarding partners, communicated clearly to relevant agencies and staff, and reflected \nin published arrangements (chapter 2, paragraphs 103-105 on Publication of \narrangements). \n43. As police and health boundaries often cover multiple local authorities, they are \nusually part of more than one multi-agency safeguarding arrangement. Reflecting this,\nengagement and collaboration through multi-agency safeguarding arrangements can \nextend beyond the geographical borders of their local area (for example, regionally or \nacross different strategic arrangements and boards). There is an expectation that lead \nsafeguarding partners should decide how best to contribute to the local arrangements \nthey are responsible for. \n44. There are interdependencies between local arrangements and other strategic \npartnership work happening locally to support children and families. This will include but \nnot be limited to other public boards, including Health and Wellbeing Boards, Adult \nSafeguarding Boards, Channel Panels, Improvement Boards, Community Safety \nPartnerships, the Local Family Justice Board, Multi-Agency Public Protection \nArrangements (MAPPA) Strategic Management Boards, local drug partnerships, domestic \nabuse partnership boards, Corporate Parenting Board, Youth Offending Management \nBoard and, where relevant, Violence Reduction Units. It is for local areas to decide how \nbest to coordinate these boards and partnerships to reflect local need. \n45. Local safeguarding arrangements will need to reflect health and care infrastructure \nsuch as ICBs, Integrated Care Systems, local maternity and neonatal systems, provider \ncollaboratives, primary care networks and NHS specialised commissioning arrangements. \n46. It is particularly important that all partners collaborate to ensure that children are \nplaced as close to home as possible and are able to continue to access services in their \nlocal area which support their safety and wellbeing.\n19 Children Act 2004 Section 16J\n",

Strong, joined-up leadership and clear accountability is critical to effective multi\u0002agency safeguarding, bringing together the various organisations and agencies. It is \ntherefore important that the head of each statutory safeguarding partner agency plays an \nactive role in these arrangements. They (hereafter ‘lead safeguarding partner’ or ‘LSP’) \nhave been named because they are able to: \n• speak with authority for the safeguarding partner they represent\n• take decisions on behalf of their organisation or agency and commit them on policy, \nresourcing, and practice matters \n• hold their own organisation or agency to account on how effectively they participate \nand implement the local arrangements\n48. The LSPs for safeguarding partners are: Chief Executives of Local Authorities20, \nChief Executives of the ICBs, and Chief Officers of police forces21. \n49. Each LSP is responsible for discharging their own statutory and legislative duties to \nsafeguard and promote the welfare of children. As leaders of their organisations and the \nstatutory safeguarding partners, it is for LSPs to assure themselves that their local \narrangements are effective and keep children safe. This includes systems of assurance \nand accountability within each of their organisations, including inspection findings.\n50. LSPs are jointly responsible for ensuring the proper involvement of and oversight of \nall relevant agencies, and should act as a team, as opposed to a voice for their agency \nalone. They should meet sufficiently regularly to undertake the following core functions: \nThrough what mechanism and how often is for local decision. \n20 Head of paid service: Local Government and Housing Act 1989 Section 4 \n21 A chief police officer is the most senior police officer in a police force as defined in the Police Act 1996 Section 101\n",

LSPs should create an environment which enables all schools28 (including \nindependent schools and academy trusts), colleges, early years, and other education and \nchildcare providers in the local area to be fully engaged, involved and included in local \nsafeguarding arrangements. This means making sure that the views and contributions of \neducation and childcare providers are articulated at the highest level of decision-making. \nAlthough it may be challenging for a single education or childcare leader to speak on \nbehalf of all local providers, LSPs should have an education representative at strategic \ndiscussions representing the education sector. These local leaders will bring insights on \nthe experiences of children locally, and on how arrangements impact on the education \nand childcare system. \n78. Most local multi-agency safeguarding arrangements include systems to ensure \nengagement and collaboration at the operational level, such as through education sub\u0002groups and networks, practitioner forums involving designated safeguarding leads29, and \nnominated education representatives. Some safeguarding partners already recognise the \nneed to ensure education providers have a voice at the strategic decision-making level \nand reflect this in their structures. Published arrangements and yearly reports should \noutline how education providers are engaged and consulted with at both the operational \nand strategic levels, how this then impacts on decision-making, what it means to be a \nrelevant agency in their local area, and how they can escalate an issue. \n79. Education providers, including multi-academy trusts, have a responsibility to play \ntheir full part in local safeguarding arrangements, including where their footprint extends \nacross several local authority areas. This includes, but should not be limited to, \nresponding to safeguarding audits of quality and compliance30, as requested by the local \nauthority and/or local safeguarding partners. This is to ensure that policies are consistent \nwith the local multi-agency safeguarding arrangements and relevant legislation and/or \nregulations. They should also provide staff and governor training that meets local and \nnational safeguarding requirements31. Education providers where required should report \ntheir audits to their governing bodies and proprietors to be shared as requested by the \nLSPs. Training for designated safeguarding leads and designated teachers should include \nshared understanding about different levels of need and how these need to be responded \nto. Education providers also play a vital role in sharing and contributing to key information \nabout children, including attendance data, exclusions, concerns about abuse, neglect, \nexploitation, and wider social and environmental factors including extra-familial contexts, \nwhich are a key aspect of keeping children safe. \n28 Statutory guidance Keeping children safe in education defines “all schools” as “maintained, non-maintained or independent schools \n(including academies, free schools, and alternative provision academies), maintained nursery schools and pupil referral units”\n29 Named child protection or safeguarding lead: NSPCC Learning\n30 Children Act 2004 Section 11, Education Act 2002 Section 157, Education Act 2002 Section 175, Children and Social Work Act 2017\nSection 16H \n31 Keeping children safe in education\n",

LSPs should consider the value of including VCSEs in their local arrangements, \nregardless of whether they are named in the 2018 Regulations.

The decision on how best to implement a robust system of independent scrutiny is \nto be made locally, and LSPs should be assured that the system in place leads to \nobjective and rigorous analysis of local arrangements. \n94. Statutory partners and relevant agencies should review progress against agreed \npriorities and identify areas for scrutiny, with a focus on achieving outcomes for children. \n95. Scrutiny should be based on sharing and analysis of local and national data, \nintelligence, and information. This could include the development of multi-agency \ndashboards, joint needs assessments, multi-agency audits, reviews, and mapping of what \nis already being scrutinised by the statutory safeguarding partners and relevant agencies, \nidentifying the gaps and aligning with agreed priorities.\n96. Independent scrutiny can be delivered through a range of methods and structures. \nLocal areas may choose to have an individual or an externally commissioned group \ndelivering their scrutiny. Furthermore, scrutiny may be embedded within the structure of \nthe arrangement or set apart from it. Scrutiny work can be undertaken through interviews, \nfocus groups, data analysis, observations, and peer review. Scrutiny should take account \nof the voice and experience of children and their families. \n97. The approach to independent scrutiny should be clearly set out and accessible. \nThe published arrangements should state how independent scrutiny is delivered locally \nand by whom, how the arrangements are reviewed and how regularly, which areas will be \nscrutinised, and how any recommendations will be taken forward. This might include the \nprocess and timescales for ongoing review of the arrangements, and the effectiveness of \nlearning following serious incidents. In the yearly report, the LSPs should review the\nimpact and learning from scrutiny and how they are responding to the findings to improve \nthe effectiveness of arrangements (see chapter 2, paragraphs 101-102 on Reporting).\nFunding \n98. The LSP should agree on the level of funding needed to deliver the multi-agency \nsafeguarding arrangements. This includes consideration of business and analytical \nsupport, independent scrutiny, infrastructure, and core functions including local children \nsafeguarding practice reviews, multi-agency training and learning events. It is the \nresponsibility of the LSP to ensure that adequate funding is allocated and spent in line \nwith agreed priorities.\n99. Funding contributions from the statutory safeguarding partners should be equitable \nand agreed by the LSP. Funding for the arrangements should be reviewed on an ongoing \nbasis to ensure that they can meet the financial needs of the arrangements.\n",

Often families are \nable to overcome challenges themselves or with the help of relatives, friends and \nservices, such as schools, youth services, health visiting and mental health services. \nHowever, sometimes families will have more significant needs that require more intensive \nhelp and support. \n115. This chapter outlines how agencies, organisations and individuals work together to \nprovide help, support, and protection in early help40, through statutory services under \nsection 17 of the Children Act 198941 and through section 47 of the Children Act 198942\n(child protection enquires and processes). \nLocal criteria for providing help, support, and protection \n116. Safeguarding partners should agree with their relevant agencies the criteria for \ndifferent levels of assessment to inform which services are commissioned and delivered in \ntheir local area and ensure that the right help is given to children at the right time. This \nshould include services for children who have suffered or are likely to suffer abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation whether from within or outside the home. This should also \ninclude a range of appropriate services for disabled children and be aligned with the short \nbreaks services statement43. \n117. The safeguarding partners should publish a threshold document, which sets out the \nlocal criteria for action in a way that is transparent, evidence-based, accessible, and easily \nunderstood. This should include:\n• the process for early help assessments, and the type and level of early help and \ntargeted early help services to be provided under sections 10 and 11 of the \nChildren Act 200444\n40 Early help is a system of support which aims to support children and families as soon as problems emerge. Some early help support \nis described as ‘targeted early help’ and is provided to children and families who are identified by practitioners to have multiple or \ncomplex needs requiring a specialist and/or multi-agency response but where statutory intervention is not needed.\n41 Child in need refers to the statutory support provided under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 for a child who is unlikely to reach or \nmaintain a satisfactory level of health or development, or their health or development will be significantly impaired without the provision \nof children’s social care services, or the child is disabled. The duty to provide support is on the local authority.\n42 Under section 47 of the Children Act 1989, where a child is the subject of an emergency protection order or is in police protection or \nthere is reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives, or is found, in their area is suffering or is likely to suffer, significant harm, \nthe local authority must make or cause to be made enquiries to decide if any action must be taken to safeguard or promote the child’s \nwelfare.\n43 Required under the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011\n44 The Children Act 2004 Section 10 requires each local authority to make arrangements to promote co-operation between the \nauthority, each of the authority’s relevant partners and such other persons or bodies working with children in the local authority’s area \nas the authority considers appropriate. Section 11 places duties on a range of organisations and individuals to give regard to the need \nto safeguard and promote the welfare of children.\n",

Early help is support for children of all ages that improves a family’s resilience and \noutcomes or reduces the chance of a problem getting worse. It is not an individual \nservice, but a system of support delivered by local authorities and their partners working \ntogether and taking collective responsibility to provide the right provision in their area. \nSome early help is provided through “universal services”45, such as education and health\nservices. They are universal services because they are available to all families, regardless \nof their needs. Other early help services are coordinated by a local authority and/or their \npartners to address specific concerns within a family and can be described as targeted \nearly help. Examples of these include parenting support, mental health support, youth \nservices, youth offending teams and housing and employment services. Early help may \nbe appropriate for children and families who have several needs, or whose circumstances \nmight make them more vulnerable. It is a voluntary approach, requiring the family’s \nconsent to receive support and services offered. These may be provided before and/or \nafter statutory intervention. \n119.

Local authorities also have a statutory duty to secure sufficient suitable education \nand training provision for all young people aged 16 to 19 and for those up to age 25 with a \nlearning difficulty assessment or, EHC plan, in their area59. They should make available to \nyoung people aged 13 to 19 and to those up to the age of 25 with a learning difficulty \nassessment or EHC plan, support that will encourage, enable or assist them to participate \nin education or training60. \n128. As education and childcare settings have daily contact with most children and \nfamilies, they are uniquely placed to identify concerns and, with partners as appropriate, \naddress them early. Safeguarding professionals, including safeguarding partners and their \ndelegates, should work closely with education and childcare settings to ensure information \nabout children is shared effectively, risks of harm are correctly identified and understood, \nand children and families receive the services they need. This includes, but is not limited \nto, information, such as increased absence or mental health problems, which may be \nindicators that a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering neglect, abuse, and\nexploitation.\n129. Those working in education and childcare settings need to be aware of how \nchildren’s experiences can impact on their mental health, behaviour, attendance and \nprogress at nursery, school, or college. Where children have suffered abuse, neglect and \nexploitation, or other potentially traumatic adverse childhood experiences, this can have a \nlasting impact throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood61.\n130. It is important that relevant information where children are home educated is \nshared between local authorities, schools, colleges, and other relevant partners. Parents \nhave a right to educate their children at home providing the education is suitable62. When \na child of school age is not a registered pupil at a school and is not receiving suitable \neducation at home, this could be an indicator of neglect, abuse, or exploitation.

Operation Encompass works by directly \nconnecting the police with schools. When officers have attended a domestic abuse incident, police share the information with a \nschool’s trained Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) before the start of the next school day, so that school staff can provide \nappropriate emotional and practical support at the earliest opportunity to children affected by domestic abuse\n62 The Education Act 1996 Section 436A (3) defines “suitable education” as efficient full-time education suitable to age, ability and \naptitude and to any special educational needs\n63 The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006, as amended by The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) \n(Amendment) Regulations 2016\n",

Some of \nthese services may be delivered directly to parents but should always be evaluated to \ndemonstrate the impact they are having on the outcomes for the child. \n137. The Early Help System Guide provides operational guidance on the delivery of \nwhole family working in the early help system. Local areas should have agreed a set of \nmeasures at family, cohort, demand, and population level to evidence the effectiveness of \nearly help, looking particularly at whether whole family need has been addressed and how \nfamily voice has informed services. This enables shared responsibility for improved \noutcomes, recognising that no one organisation delivers a specific outcome on their own. \nSection 2: Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children\n138. Local authorities have statutory duties to support certain groups of children in their \narea. Under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, local authorities are under a general duty\nto provide support for children who are unlikely to reach or maintain a satisfactory level of \nhealth or development, or their health or development will be significantly impaired without \nthe provision of services, or the child is disabled. Where there is reasonable cause to \nsuspect a child is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm, local authorities must make \nenquiries and decide if any action must be taken under section 47 of the Children Act \n1989.\n139. Where requested to do so by local authority children’s social care, health \norganisations, other local authorities and other parts of the local authority, such as \nhousing, have a duty to co-operate under section 27 of the Children Act 198970 by \nassisting the local authority in carrying out its children’s social care functions, provided\nthat this is compatible with their own duties and obligations and does not interfere with the \n70 Children Act 1989 Section 27 (2): an authority whose help is so requested shall comply with the request if it is compatible with their \nown statutory or other duties and obligations and does not unduly prejudice the discharge of any of their functions.\n",

Local authorities, with their safeguarding partners and any relevant agencies, \nshould develop, agree, and publish local protocols for assessments and support. This \nUnder the Children Act 1989, local authorities are under a general duty to provide \nservices for children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their \nwelfare. A child in need is defined under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 as a child \nwho is unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable level of health or development, or \nwhose health and development is likely to be significantly or further impaired without \nthe provision of services, or a child who is disabled.\nTo fulfil this duty, practitioners undertake assessments of the needs of individual \nchildren, giving due regard to a child’s age and understanding when determining what, \nif any, services to provide. \nEvery assessment must be informed by the views of the child as well as the family, \nand a child’s wishes and feelings must be sought regarding the provision of services \nto be delivered. Where possible, children should be seen alone. Where a child \nrequests to be seen with a trusted adult, this should be supported. A child’s \ncommunication needs should be taken into account. When assessing children in need \nand providing services, specialist assessments may be required and, where possible, \nshould be co-ordinated so that the child and family experience a coherent process and \na single plan of action.\nSome children in need may require accommodation because there is no one who has \nparental responsibility for them, they are lost or abandoned, or the person who has \nbeen caring for them is prevented from providing them with suitable accommodation \nor care. Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, the local authority has a duty to \naccommodate such children in need in their area. \nUnder section 47 of the Children Act 1989, where a local authority has reasonable \ncause to suspect that a child who lives or is found in their area is suffering or is likely \nto suffer significant harm, it has a duty to make such enquiries as it considers \nnecessary to decide whether to take any action to safeguard or promote the child’s \nwelfare. Such enquiries, supported by other organisations and agencies, as \nappropriate, should be initiated where there are concerns about all forms of abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation whether this is taking place in person or online, inside or \noutside of the child’s home. \nThere may be a need for immediate protection whilst an assessment or enquiries are \ncarried out. Further information about immediate protection can be found in this \nguidance on page 85.\n",

For children in need of immediate protection, action must be taken by the local \nauthority, the police (including British Transport Police) or the NSPCC77 if removal is \nrequired. This should happen as soon as possible after the referral has been made to \nlocal authority children’s social care78 79. \n155. The maximum timeframe for the assessment to conclude, such that it is possible to \nreach a decision on next steps, should be no longer than 45 working days from the point \nof referral. If, in discussion with a child and their family and other practitioners, an \nassessment exceeds 45 working days, the lead practitioner should record the reasons for \nexceeding the time limit. In some cases, the needs of the child will mean that a quick \nassessment will be required.

The lead practitioner role can be held by a range of people, including social \nworkers.

If family group decision-making cannot be conducted at this point, the local \nauthority should still consider this as an option later, including as a route to reunification \nwith the birth parents or family network where appropriate. \n185. Family group decision-making, including the family group conference model, \npromotes the involvement of the family network in decision-making about a child’s safety \nor wellbeing. Family group decision-making forums offer a way of ensuring that all \nresources within the family’s wider networks have been engaged for the benefit of the \nchild and empower family networks to come to a decision on how this can be done.\nFamily group decision-making is an entirely voluntary process for the family and requires \ninformed consent. This should be a family-led forum, where a family network has all the \nresources, adequate preparation, relevant information, a safe and appropriate \nenvironment, and “private family time” to make a plan to respond to concerns about a \nchild’s safety or wellbeing. At pre-proceedings stage, a successful family group decision\u0002making forum, such as a family group conference, also include having an independent \ncoordinator91. \n186.

This \nincludes where children are likely to transition between child and adult services, where \nthey move from one local authority to another and where they move between schools. \nSupporting disabled children and their carers\n187. A crucial role of children’s social care is to provide help and support to disabled \nchildren and their families. When undertaking an assessment of a disabled child, \npractitioners should recognise the additional pressures on the family, and the distinct \nchallenges they may have had to negotiate as a result of their child’s disability. \n188. The assessment process should focus on the needs of the child and family, be \nstrengths-based, and gather information to inform decisions on the help needed to:\n• ensure the child achieves the best possible outcomes\n• enable the child’s family to continue in their caring role where that is right for the \nchild\n• safeguard children in cases where there is abuse, neglect, and exploitation\n91 Court Orders and Pre-proceedings guidance 2014\n",

Such an assessment must consider whether it is appropriate for the parent \ncarer to provide, or continue to provide, care for the disabled child.

If a local authority considers that a young carer (see glossary) may have support \nneeds, it must carry out an assessment under section 17ZA of the Children Act 198995 to \nestablish how best they can support the young carer and their family. The local authority \nmust also carry out such an assessment if a young carer, or the parent of a young carer, \nrequests one. Such an assessment must consider whether it is appropriate or excessive \nfor the young carer to provide care for the person in question, (which may be a sibling, \nparent, or other member of the family), in light of the young carer’s needs and wishes. The \nYoung Carers (Needs Assessment) Regulations 201596 require local authorities to look at \nthe needs of the whole family when carrying out a young carer’s needs assessment. Local \nauthorities must consider whether to combine a young carer’s needs assessment with any \nother assessment of the needs for support of the young carer, the person cared for, or a \nmember of the young carer’s family. \n193. Information on whether a child has been identified as a young carer will be \ncollected annually through the school census from January 2023. Schools do not need to \nobtain parental or pupil consent to provide this information for the purposes of the census \nbut should respect the wishes and feelings of both children and their parents.\nSupporting children at risk of, or experiencing, harm outside \nthe home\n194. Some children experience abuse and exploitation outside the home. This is often \nreferred to as “extra-familial harm”97. Harm can occur in a range of extra-familial contexts, \nincluding school and other educational settings, peer groups, or within community/public \nspaces, and/or online. Children may experience this type of harm from other children \nand/or from adults. Forms of extra-familial harm include exploitation by criminal and \norganised crime groups and individuals (such as county lines and financial exploitation),\nserious violence, modern slavery and trafficking, online harm, sexual exploitation, teenage \nrelationship abuse, and the influences of extremism which could lead to radicalisation98 99. \nChildren of all ages can experience extra-familial harm. \n195. Where there are concerns that a child is experiencing extra-familial harm, \npractitioners should consider all the needs and vulnerabilities of the child. Some children \n95 Children Act 1989 Section 17ZA\n96 The Young Carers (Needs Assessment) Regulations 2015\n97 See Appendix A: glossary\n98 Extremist groups may make use of the internet to radicalise and recruit and to promote extremist materials.

Key decisions should be recorded and communicated to both the child and their \nparents or carers, so that everyone understands the action that has, or will be, taken to \nsafeguard and promote their welfare. It is important that all partners are clear how actions \ncontribute to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the child105. \nThe National Referral Mechanism \n200. The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) is the UK’s system for identifying victims \nof modern slavery and human trafficking. If a first responder106 has concerns that a child \nmay be a potential victim of modern slavery or human trafficking (including through county \nlines) then a referral should be made to the NRM, as soon as possible. A child’s consent \nis not needed for a referral to be made107. \n201. Independent Child Trafficking Guardians (ICTG) are an independent source of \nadvice for children who have been trafficked and somebody who can speak up on their \nbehalf. Where the ICTG service has been implemented108, if the first responder considers\na child to be a potential victim of modern slavery or human trafficking, they should refer \nthem to the ICTG service. This is in addition to following usual safeguarding routes and \nNRM referrals. The NRM referral and ICTG referral should be made in parallel.\nSupporting children in secure youth establishments\n202.

Prisons will also decide on the level of \ncontact, if any, they will allow between a prisoner and a child based on a child contact risk \nassessment115 and will prohibit or restrict a prisoner’s contact with a child where \nnecessary. \n207. In response to a child safeguarding enquiry, children's social care should: \n• review information provided by the Prison Service and record it as required\n• respond to a child safeguarding enquiry and share with the Prison Service any \nconcerns about the prisoner and any contact with a child\n• contribute to the prisons’ child contact risk assessment where a child is known to \nchildren's social care, or has previously been known, by providing a report on the \nchild's best interests and verifying the child's identity. Where the child is not known \nto children’s social care, they should still provide a view on child contact and should \nadvise the prison to complete a child safeguarding referral if one is required \n208. The Probation Service will share information with children’s social care about \nsupervised individuals who have contact with children or who pose a known risk and will \nalso request information by making child safeguarding enquiries. Information exchange \nbetween probation and children’s social care help both agencies develop a better \nunderstanding of the children and families they work with and ensures risk assessments \nare accurate and well informed.\n209. Under the UKGDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 sharing of personal information \nof an offender must be lawful and fair and must comply with Part 3 of the Data Protection \nAct 2018 and in particular the data protection principles. Sharing of information for the \npurposes of law enforcement and keeping children and young people safe meets one of \nthe requirements for lawful processing under the Data Protection Act 2018 as the data \nsharing is authorised by law (under section 325(3) and (4) of the Criminal Justice Act \n2003) (or section 14 of the Offender Management Act 2007). It is therefore not necessary \nfor Prison and Probation Service staff to obtain consent from the offender under the Data \nProtection Act 2018. \n114 The HMPPS Child Safeguarding Policy Framework sets out that a child safeguarding enquiry (sometimes referred to as a \nsafeguarding check) is an official enquiry that HMPPS staff send to local authority children’s social care to request information on an \nindividual, child or family.\n115 The child contact risk assessment process is explained in Chapter 5b of the Public Protection Manual (PPM) PSI 18/2016.\n",

The assessment should be led \nby a lead practitioner and approved by a social work qualified practice supervisor or \nmanager. Local authorities have a duty to ascertain the child’s wishes and feelings \nand take account of them when planning the provision of services. Assessments \nshould be carried out in a timely manner reflecting the needs of the individual child, as \nset out in this chapter.\nWhere the local authority children’s social care decides to provide services, a multi\u0002agency child in need plan should be developed which sets out which organisations \nand agencies will provide which services to the child and family. The plan should set \nclear measurable outcomes for the child and expectations for the parents. The plan \nshould reflect the positive aspects of the family situation as well as the weaknesses, \nacknowledging any factors beyond the family that may be undermining their capacity \nto parent or keep their child safe.\nWhere a child in need has moved permanently to another local authority area, the \noriginal local authority should ensure that all relevant information (including the child in \nneed plan) is shared with the receiving local authority as soon as possible. The \nreceiving local authority should consider whether support services are still required \nand discuss with the child and family what might be needed, based on a timely re\u0002assessment of the child’s needs, as set out in this chapter. Support should continue to \nbe provided by the original local authority in the intervening period. The receiving local\nauthority should work with the original local authority to ensure that any changes to the \nservices and support provided are managed carefully.\nWhere a child in need is approaching 18 years of age, this transition point should be \nplanned for in advance. This includes where children are likely to transition between \nchild and adult services. \nWhere information gathered during an assessment result in the lead practitioner and \nsocial work qualified practice supervisor or manager suspecting that the child is \nsuffering or likely to suffer significant harm, the local authority should hold a strategy \ndiscussion to enable it to decide, with other agencies, whether it must initiate enquiries \nunder section 47 of the Children Act 1989.\n",

Children who need protecting may include those \nwho experience harm in their own family and those who are harmed or exploited by \nothers, including their peers, in their community and/or online. Suffering or being likely to \nsuffer significant harm is the threshold for child protection enquiries and can take different \nforms, including sexual, physical or emotional abuse, neglect or domestic abuse\n(including controlling or coercive behaviour119), exploitation by criminal gangs or\norganised crime groups, trafficking, online abuse, sexual exploitation, and the influences \nof extremism which could lead to radicalisation. \n213. Child protection is the set of multi-agency activities and processes that follow a \nconcern that a child is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm. Under section 47 of the \nChildren Act 1989, the local authority has a duty to make enquiries when this is the case \nand to take decisive action when needed to protect a child from abuse, neglect, and\nexploitation. Practitioners responsible for child protection decision-making should be \nskilled, experienced and have the right expertise to collate, analyse and distil complex \ninformation in a changing context. Where child protection enquiries are necessary, the \nlead practitioner should always be a social worker. \n214. Whatever the form of abuse, neglect and exploitation, practitioners should: \n• put the needs of children first when determining what action to take\n• speak to the child at the earliest opportunity to understand what is happening in \ntheir daily life, recognising that the child may express this through their actions and \nbehaviours \n• work with the family to build trusting and co-operative relationships with parents \nand carers, in line with the principles for working with parents and carers set out in \nchapter 1 of this guidance \n• use their skills and experience to recognise circumstances where the parent is \nreluctant to engage and seek to understand the factors that might underly this, \nincluding types of domestic abuse that are resulting in coercive or controlling\nbehaviour which limits the parent’s capacity to engage\n118 Children Act 2004 \n119 Serious Crime Act 2015 Section 76 provides information regarding circumstances when a child cannot be considered a victim of \ncoercive or controlling behaviour.\n",

Other relevant practitioners will \ndepend on the nature of the individual case but may include those who have concerns \nabout the child and/or those involved in the child’s life, for example:\n• the practitioner or agency which made the referral \n• the child’s school or nursery\n• any health or care services the child or family members are receiving\n• youth justice practitioner and/or youth worker\n• adult mental health, substance misuse and/or domestic abuse specialist\n• British Transport Police representative \nAll attendees should be sufficiently senior to make decisions on behalf of their \norganisation and agencies. They should be sufficiently skilled and experienced to \nprepare for and engage with the strategy discussion and be able to critically assess \nand challenge their own and others’ input.\n",

In this instance, the local \nauthority should determine whether to initiate pre-proceedings and follow the ‘Court \norders and pre-proceedings guidance for local authorities’\n122. This decision should be \ninformed by engagement with other relevant agencies. During this period, the local \nauthority should offer family group decision-making, such as family group conferences, \nto continue to explore potential placements within the family network and to clarify the \nrealistic options available for the child. At pre-proceedings, records of key discussions \nwith the family can be used as evidence of decision-making123. \nThe pre-proceedings process acts as the final opportunity for parents to avoid care \nproceedings. Whilst pre-proceedings may be initiated at this final stage as per flow chart \n6, where the local authority considers the “threshold” for care proceedings to be met, \nproceedings can be initiated at any stage.\nThe local authority should work in partnership with families and, where possible, any \nextra support or services needed to support the family should be identified and put in \nplace. There should be clear expectations set with parents about the changes they are \nrequired to make.\nLink to the full statutory guidance on court orders and pre-proceedings can be found in \nAppendix B of this document, titled “Children Act 1989: court orders and pre\u0002proceedings”. \nWhen initiating pre-proceedings, practitioners should review Practice Direction 12A, the \nlink can also be found in Appendix B. The pre-proceedings checklist in this Practice \nDirection outlines the documentation that must be prepared in pre-proceedings or \nbefore and submitted as part of the local authority application for a court order.\nPractitioners and strategic leads can also refer to the family justice hub for access to \nresources and tools to support the delivery of best practice in pre-proceedings. A link to \nthese resources can be found in Appendix B, titled “Pre-proceedings and family justice \nhub”. \n121 The Children Act 1989 Section 31 (2)\n122 Court Orders and Pre-proceedings for Local Authorities (2014)\n123 Practice direction 12A – Care supervision and other part 4 proceedings: guide to case management.\n",

Children have the right to the full protection offered by \ncriminal law. In addition to identifying when a child may be a victim of a crime, police \nofficers should be aware of the effect of other incidents which might pose safeguarding \nrisks to children and where officers should pay particular attention. Harm may be indirect \nand non-physical as, for example, in the case of some domestic abuse which may involve \ncontrolling or coercive behaviour, or economic abuse. An officer attending a domestic \nabuse incident should be aware of the effect of such behaviour on any children in the \nhousehold and recognise that children who see, hear, or experience the effects of \ndomestic abuse are victims in their own right139. \n246.

Under Part 1 of the Housing Act \n2004147, authorities must take account of the impact of health and safety hazards in \nhousing on vulnerable occupants, including children, when deciding on the action to be \ntaken by landlords to improve conditions. Housing authorities also have an important role \nto play in safeguarding vulnerable young people, including young people who are \npregnant, leaving care or a secure establishment.\nHomelessness duty \n256. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 significantly reformed England’s \nhomelessness legislation by placing duties on local authorities to intervene at earlier \nstages to prevent homelessness in their areas. \n257. It added section 213B into the Housing Act 1996148, which is a duty on certain \npublic authorities to refer to a housing authority service users they consider are or may be \nhomeless or threatened with homelessness (meaning it is likely they will become \nhomeless within 56 days). \n258. The duty to refer applies to all social services functions, including early help, \nleaving care and child protection, and is intended to increase early identification and \nintervention, which is critical for safeguarding against homelessness. Earlier intervention \ncan help prevent children becoming homeless, and the possibility of them being \nconsidered ‘intentionally homeless’ and so not owed a long-term housing duty.\n259. Before making a referral, a public authority must:\n• have the individual’s consent to the referral (although referrals without consent may \nbe made in order to safeguard children or vulnerable adults, in accordance with \nlocal procedures)\n• allow the individual to identify the housing authority in England which they would \nlike the notification to be made to\n• have consent from the individual that their contact details can be supplied so the \nhousing authority can contact them regarding the referral\n260. The referral to a housing authority must include the individual’s name, contact \ndetails, and the agreed reason for referral (for example, that the individual is homeless or \nat risk of homelessness). Further referral information may include:\n147 Housing Act 2004 Part 1\n148 Housing Act 1996 Section 213B\n",

This includes investigating offences \nperpetrated against children, such as through the Modern Slavery Act 2015 where \nchildren have been exploited, removing a child to a suitable place using their police \nprotection powers under the Children Act 1989151, and the protection of children who are \ntruanting from school using powers under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998152. \nThe Prison Service \n264.

When appropriate, the Probation Service should \nshare risk assessments and RMPs with other organisations and agencies involved in the \nmanagement of the offender’s risk. Probation practitioners will also work with children’s \nsocial care to ensure that RMPs align with child protection and child in need plans. \n279. The sentence plan includes specific child safeguarding objectives for those \noffenders who pose a risk of serious harm to children or where there are child \nsafeguarding concerns. Probation practitioners will also consider how a planned \nintervention might affect the offender’s caring or parental responsibilities or contribute to \nimproved outcomes for children known to be in an existing relationship with the offender. \n280. Probation practitioners are experienced in working with offenders and assessing \nrisk. Suitably qualified probation practitioners will attend child protection conferences, core \ngroup meetings and other child safeguarding meetings where required. They will provide \nan assessment of the offender’s risk and will assess how the offender’s behaviour might \nimpact the wellbeing of children. Probation practitioners should prepare and submit \nreports in a timely way168. \n281. The Probation Service may hold valuable information on the parents of a child who \nis known to children’s social care and other agencies. The probation caseload is \npredominantly male and includes men who pose a risk to children, and men who may play \na nurturing role, and have a positive impact on a child’s wellbeing. These men can often \ngo unseen169 by agencies who do not ordinarily come into contact with men in the criminal \njustice system. This puts the Prison and Probation Service in a unique position to \ncontribute to safeguarding work other agencies undertake with children and families. \nMulti-agency public protection arrangements \n282. Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) is the set of arrangements \nthrough which the Police, Probation and Prison Services (known as the Responsible \nAuthority) work together with other agencies to manage the risks posed by violent, sexual \nand terrorism offenders living in the community to protect the public.\n283. MAPPA is not a statutory body but is a mechanism through which agencies can \nbetter discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated \nmanner. Agencies retain their full statutory responsibilities and obligations. \n168 The HMPPS child safeguarding policy framework sets out how probation practitioners are expected to participate in formal \nmeetings with children’s social care\n169 Unseen men: learning from case reviews: NSPCC Learning\n",

Section 325(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003170 requires the Responsible \nAuthority (RA) to co-operate with certain agencies, such as local authorities, including \nChildren’s Social Care. They are known as Duty to Co-operate Agencies (DTC agencies). \nThis is a reciprocal duty, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 obliges DTC agencies to co\u0002operate with the RA in establishing arrangements and includes co-operating with other \nDTC agencies. DTC agencies are required to co-operate as far as they can, consistent \nwith the exercise of their statutory functions.\n285. Representatives from other agencies or individuals that do not have a statutory \nDuty to Cooperate under MAPPA (Associate Agencies) may be included in MAPPA on a \ncase-by-case basis where that agency or individual can contribute to the risk assessment \nand management of a MAPPA offender. Potential Associate Agencies covered by \nWorking Together include:\n• independent schools, academies, and free and maintained schools\n• early years and childcare\n• private sector healthcare\n• designated health professionals\n• the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service\n• voluntary, charity, social enterprise, faith-based organisations, and private sectors.\n• sports clubs/organisations \n• youth services and youth work organisations\n286. Whenever a child is discussed at a MAPPA meeting, the meeting must ensure that \nit considers its responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of that child and how \ntheir life may be impacted by the behaviour of an offender. Where a child is managed \nunder MAPPA the risk of harm the child presents to others must be addressed but\nchildren convicted of an offence or who are alleged to have engaged in offending \nbehaviour are entitled to the same safeguards and protection as any other child and due \nregard should be given to their welfare at all times.\n287. The purpose of sharing information about individuals (data subjects) under MAPPA \nis to enable the relevant agencies to work together more effectively in assessing risks and \nconsidering how to manage them in order to protect the public. Agencies should share all \nrelevant information, so that public protection is not compromised, while respecting the \nrights of data subjects, which may limit what can be shared. These rights are set out in \nPart 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 and Article 8 of the European Convention on \n170 Criminal Justice Act 2003 Section 325 (3)\n",

This means that \nall information sharing under MAPPA is governed by Part 3 of the Data Protection Act \n2018, rather than UK GDPR172. \nSerious violence duty\n289. The Serious Violence Duty was introduced as part of the Police Crime Sentencing \nand Courts Act 2022173 and requires specified authorities namely police, Justice \n(Probation and YOTs), Fire and Rescue Service, Health (ICBs) in England, and Local \nHealth Boards in Wales, and local authorities to work together to prevent and reduce \nserious violence. This includes identifying the kinds of serious violence174 that occur in the \narea, the causes of that violence (so far as it is possible to do so), and to prepare and \nimplement a strategy for preventing, and reducing serious violence in the area. \n290. The Duty also requires the specified authorities to consult relevant authorities, \nnamely educational, prison and youth custody authorities for the area in the preparation of \ntheir strategy. The Duty takes a multi-agency approach to understand the causes and \nconsequences of serious violence, focusing on prevention and early intervention, and \ninformed by evidence. It does not require new multi-agency structures and encourages \nthe use of existing local structures and partnerships to prevent and reduce serious \nviolence and ultimately improve community safety and safeguarding. \n291. The Duty provisions commenced on 31 January 2023 and local partners will then \nhave to publish their first serious violence strategy by 31 January 2024 and then review it \nas appropriate.

Child protection in England is a complex multi-agency system with many different \norganisations and individuals playing their part. Reflecting on how well that system is \nworking is critical in improving our response to children and their families. \n319. Sometimes a child suffers a serious injury or death as a result of abuse or neglect. \nUnderstanding not only what happened but also why it happened can help improve our \nresponse in the future. Appreciating the impact that organisations and agencies had on \nthe child’s life, and on the lives of their family members, and whether or not different \napproaches or those actions could have resulted in a different outcome, is essential. It is \nin this way that we can make good judgements about what might need to change at a \nlocal or national level. \nPurpose of child safeguarding practice reviews\n320. The purpose of serious child safeguarding case reviews, at local and national level, \nis to identify improvements that can be made to safeguard and promote the welfare of \nchildren. Learning is relevant locally but has a wider importance for all practitioners \nworking with children and families and for the government and policymakers. \nUnderstanding whether there are systemic issues, and whether and how policy and \npractice need to change, is critical to the system being dynamic and self-improving. \n321. Reviews should seek to prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of similar \nincidents. They are not conducted to hold individuals, organisations, or agencies to \naccount, as there are other processes for that purpose, including employment law and \ndisciplinary procedures, professional regulation and, in exceptional cases, criminal \nproceedings. These processes may be carried out alongside a review or at a later stage. \nEmployers should consider whether any disciplinary action should be taken against \npractitioners whose conduct and/or practice falls below acceptable standards and should \nrefer to their regulatory body as appropriate. \nResponsibilities for reviews\n322. The responsibility for how the system learns the lessons from serious child \nsafeguarding incidents lies at a national level with the Child Safeguarding Practice Review \nPanel (the panel) and at a local level with the safeguarding partners.\n",

It should also oversee the system of national and local reviews and how \neffectively it is operating. \n324. As outlined in chapter 2, the safeguarding partners play an integral role in \nestablishing a system of learning and reflection locally. Safeguarding partners must:\n• identify and review serious child safeguarding cases which, in their opinion, raise \nissues of importance in relation to their area\n• commission and oversee the review of those cases if they consider it appropriate\n325. The way in which this responsibility is divided between the lead safeguarding \npartners (LSPs) and their delegates is for local decision. Accountability for ensuring \nlearning from serious incidents is implemented is the responsibility of the LSPs and the \nimpact of local and national reviews should be evidenced in yearly reports and subjected \nto independent scrutiny.\n326. The panel and safeguarding partners have a shared aim to identify improvements \nto practice for protecting children from harm and should maintain an open and ongoing \ndialogue. This will enable them to raise concerns, highlight commonly recurring areas \nneeding further investigation (whether leading to a local or national review), and share \nlearning, including from success, that could lead to improvements elsewhere. \n327. As such, safeguarding partners should have regard to any guidance the panel \npublishes. Guidance will include the timescales for a rapid review (see chapter 5, \nparagraphs 343-344) and for the panel’s response.\n328. Serious child safeguarding cases are those in which:\n• abuse or neglect of a child is known or suspected \n• the child has died or been seriously harmed\n329. Serious harm includes (but is not limited to) serious and/or long-term impairment of \na child’s mental health or intellectual, emotional, social, or behavioural development. This \nis not an exhaustive list. When making decisions, judgement should be exercised in cases \nwhere impairment is likely to be long-term, even if this is not immediately certain. Even if a \nchild recovers, including from a one-off incident, serious harm may still have occurred. \nLocal authorities and safeguarding partners should refer to the panel’s guidance192 for \nfurther clarity on issues relating to the criteria for serious child safeguarding cases.\n192 Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel guidance for safeguarding partners\n",

The death of a child is a devastating loss that profoundly affects all those involved. \nThe process of systematically reviewing the deaths of children is grounded in respect for \nthe rights of both children and their families213, with the intention of learning what \nhappened and why, and preventing future child deaths. \n377. The majority of child deaths in England arise from medical causes. Enquiries \nshould keep an appropriate balance between forensic and medical requirements and \nsupporting the family at a difficult time. This chapter provides guidance to child death \nreview partners on their statutory responsibilities. \n378. Child death review partners are local authorities and any ICBs for the local area as \nset out in the Children Act 2004, as amended by the Children and Social Work Act \n2017214. The statutory responsibilities for child death review partners are set out below, \nand the agency and organisational boundaries should be decided locally as described in \nparagraph 384 of this chapter. \n379. In the immediate aftermath of a child’s death, a copy of ‘When a child dies – a \nguide for parents and carers’\n215 should be offered to all bereaved families or carers\nthrough the child death review process. In addition to supporting families and carers, staff \ninvolved in the care of the child should also be considered and offered appropriate \nsupport.\n213 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\n214 Children Act 2004, Section 16Q\n215 When a child dies: a guide for parents and carers\n",

This should be done via a Child Death Overview Panel (CDOP).\nChild death review partners for two or more local authority areas may combine and \nagree that their areas be treated as a single area for the purpose of undertaking child \ndeath reviews. \nChild death review partners must make arrangements for the analysis of information \nfrom all deaths reviewed by the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD).\nThe purpose of a review and/or analysis is to identify any matters relating to the death, \nor deaths, that are relevant to the welfare of children in the area, or to public health and \nsafety, and to consider whether action should be taken in relation to any matters \nidentified. If child death review partners find action should be taken by a person or \norganisation, they must inform them. In addition, child death review partners:\n• must, at such times as they consider appropriate, prepare, and publish reports \non:\no what they have done as a result of the child death review \narrangements in their area\no how effective the arrangements have been in practice\n• may request information from a person or organisation to enable or assist the \nreview and/or analysis process. The person or organisation must comply with the \nrequest, and if they do not, the child death review partners may take legal action \nto seek enforcement\n• may make payments directly towards expenditure incurred in connection with \narrangements made for child death reviews or analysis of information about \ndeaths reviewed, or by contributing to a fund out of which payments may be \nmade. They may provide staff, goods, services, accommodation, or other \nresources to any person for purposes connected with the child death review or \nanalysis process\n",

In making arrangements to review child deaths, child death review partners should \nestablish a structure and process to review all deaths of children normally resident in their \narea and, as indicated and agreed between child death review partners, the deaths of \nchildren not normally resident in their area but who have died there. Child death review \npartners should model their child death review structures and processes as laid out in the \n‘Child Death Review Statutory and Operational Guidance (2018)’\n220. \n382. Child death review partners should consider the core representation of any panel \nor structure they set up to conduct reviews, and this would ideally include: \n• public health \n• the designated221 doctor for child deaths for the local area \n• social services \n• police \n• the designated doctor or nurse for safeguarding \n• primary care (GP or health visitor) \n• nursing and/or midwifery \n• lay representation \n• other professionals that child death review partners consider should be involved \nIt is for child death review partners to determine what representation they have in any \nstructure reviewing child deaths.\n383. Child death review partners should agree locally how the child death review \nprocess will be funded in their area.\n216 The guidance in this chapter is issued under the Children Act 2004 Section 16Q\n217 For the purposes of child death reviews, a local area is the area within the remit of a local authority (referred to in the Children Act\n2004 as a “local authority area”).\n218 Children Act 2004 Section 65 - a child is defined as a person under 18 years of age\n219 This will include the death of any liveborn baby, where a death certificate has been issued, or where the birth was unattended, but \ndoes not include those (of any gestation) who are stillborn where there was medical attendance or planned terminations of pregnancy \ncarried out within the law.\n220 Child Death Review: Statutory and Operational Guidance (England) \n221 Within that part of the health system that supports child safeguarding and protection services, the word “designated\" means a \ndedicated professional with specific roles and responsibilities that are centred on the provision of clinical expertise and strategic advice.\n",

It should take into \naccount networks of NHS care, and agency and organisational boundaries in order to \nreflect the integrated care and social networks of the local area. These may overlap with \nmore than one local authority area or ICB. They should cover a child population such that \nthey typically review at least 60 child deaths per year. Child death review partners should \ncome together to develop clear plans outlining the administrative and logistical processes \nfor their review arrangements. \n385. Child death review partners should ensure that a designated doctor for child \ndeaths is appointed to any multi-agency panel (or structure in place to review deaths). \nThe designated doctor for child deaths should be a senior paediatrician who can take a \nlead role in the review process. Child death review partners should ensure a process is in \nplace whereby the designated doctor for child deaths is notified of each child death and is \nsent relevant information. \n386. Child death review partners may request that a person or organisation provide \ninformation to enable or assist the reviewing or analysing of a child's death. The person or \norganisation must comply with such a request. If they do not comply, the child death \nreview partners may instigate legal action to enforce.\n387. Child death review partners for the local authority area where a child who has died \nwas normally resident are responsible for ensuring the death is reviewed. However, they \nmay also choose to review the death of a child, including a looked after child, that \noccurred in their local area even if the child in question was not normally resident there. In \nsuch circumstances, the designated doctor for child death in each area should discuss \nand agree who will be responsible for collecting information and reviewing the death, to \nensure there is no duplication of review. The review process should seek to involve child \ndeath review partners for another local authority area who had an interest in the child or \nany other person or agencies, as appropriate.\n388. Child death review partners should publicise on their website, information on the \narrangements for child death reviews in their area. This should include who the \naccountable officials are (the local authority chief executive, and the accountable officer of \nthe ICB), which local authority and ICB partners are involved, what geographical area is \ncovered and who the designated doctor for child deaths is.\n",

Harm can include ill treatment that is \nnot physical as well as the impact of witnessing ill treatment of others. This can be \nparticularly relevant, for example, in relation to the impact on children of all forms of \ndomestic abuse, including where they see, hear, or experience its effects. Children may \nbe abused in a family or in an institutional or extra-familial contexts by those known to \nthem or, more rarely, by others. Abuse can take place wholly online, or technology may \nbe used to facilitate offline abuse. Children may be abused by an adult or adults, or \nanother child or children.\nChild criminal exploitation - As set out in the Serious Violence Strategy230, published by \nthe Home Office, where an individual or group takes advantage of an imbalance of power \nto coerce, control, manipulate or deceive a child or young person under the age of 18 into \nany criminal activity (a) in exchange for something the victim needs or wants, and/or (b) \nfor the financial or other advantage of the perpetrator or facilitator and/or (c) through \nviolence or the threat of violence. The victim may have been criminally exploited even if \nthe activity appears consensual. Child criminal exploitation does not always involve \nphysical contact; it can also occur through the use of technology.\nChild death review partners - A child death review partner in relation to a local authority \narea in England is defined under the Children Act 2004 as (a) the local authority, and (b) \nany integrated care board for an area any part of which falls within the local authority \narea. The 2 partners must make arrangements for the review of each death of a child \nnormally resident in the area and may also, if they consider it appropriate, make \narrangements for the review of a death in their area of a child not normally resident there. \nThey must also make arrangements for the analysis of information about deaths reviewed \nunder this section. The purposes of a review or analysis are (a) to identify any matters \nrelating to the death or deaths that are relevant to the welfare of children in the area or to \npublic health and safety, and (b) to consider whether it would be appropriate for anyone to \ntake action in relation to any matters identified.\nChild protection - Part of safeguarding and promoting welfare. This refers to the activity \nthat is undertaken to protect specific children who are suffering, or are likely to suffer, \nsignificant harm. \nChild sexual exploitation - Child sexual exploitation is a form of child sexual abuse. It \noccurs where an individual or group takes advantage of an imbalance of power to coerce, \nmanipulate or deceive a child or young person under the age of 18 into sexual activity (a) \n230 Serious Violence Strategy\n",

The victim may have been \nsexually exploited even if the sexual activity appears consensual. Child sexual exploitation \ndoes not always involve physical contact; it can also occur through the use of technology.\nChildren - Anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday. The fact that a child has \nreached 16 years of age, is living independently or is in further education, is a member of \nthe armed forces, is in hospital or in custody in the secure estate, does not change their \nstatus or entitlements to services or protection.\nControlling or coercive behaviour - Also known as coercive control, controlling or \ncoercive behaviour is a form of domestic abuse. In 2015, the offence of controlling or \ncoercive behaviour was introduced under Section 76 of the Serious Crime Act as a \ncriminal offence. Controlling or coercive behaviour is included in the definition of domestic \nabuse in section 1(3)(c) of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.\nControlling or coercive behaviour is a pattern of abuse (on two or more occasions) that \ninvolves multiple behaviours and tactics used by a perpetrator to (but not limited to) hurt, \nhumiliate, intimidate, exploit, isolate, and dominate the victim. It is an intentional pattern of \nbehaviour used to exert power, control, or coercion over another person. Controlling or \ncoercive behaviour is often committed in conjunction with other forms of abuse and is \noften part of a wider pattern of abuse, including violent, sexual, or economic abuse. \nChildren can be used to control or coerce the victim, for example, by frustrating child \ncontact and/or child arrangements, telling the children to call the victim derogatory names \nor to hit the victim, or by threatening to abduct the children.\nThis pattern of abuse causes fear, serious alarm and/or distress which can lead to a \nsubstantial adverse effect on a victim’s day-to-day life. This can have a significant impact \non children and young people231. \nSection 68 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 came into force on 5 April 2023 and removed \nthe ‘living together’ requirement for the controlling or coercive behaviour offence, which \nmeans that the offence applies to partners, ex-partners or family members, regardless of \nwhether the victim and perpetrator live together. More information about controlling or \ncoercive behaviour, including the impact on children can be found in the Controlling or \ncoercive behaviour: statutory guidance232 and the Domestic Abuse Act 2021: statutory \nguidance233. \n231 As set out in the Serious Crime Act 2015 Section 76, a child cannot be considered a victim of coercive or controlling behaviour if \n(see sub-section 3) “A” has parental responsibility for “B” (the child) and if “B” is under the age of 16. To note, children aged 16 to 17 \ncan be considered victims of coercive or controlling behaviour in their own personal relationships.\n232 Controlling or coercive behaviour: statutory guidance \n233 Domestic Abuse Act 2021: statutory guidance\n",

They are likely to exploit \nchildren and vulnerable adults to move and store the drugs and money, and they will \noften use coercion, intimidation, violence (including sexual violence) and weapons.\nThis activity can happen locally as well as across the UK; no specified distance of travel is \nrequired. For further information see ‘Criminal exploitation of children and vulnerable \nadults: county lines’ guidance235.\nDomestic abuse - The Domestic Abuse Act 2021236 introduced the first ever statutory \ndefinition of domestic abuse (section 1 of the Act). The statutory definition is clear that \ndomestic abuse may be a single incident or a course of conduct which can encompass a \nwide range of abusive behaviours, including a) physical or sexual abuse; b) violent or \nthreatening behaviour; c) controlling or coercive behaviour; d) economic abuse; and e) \npsychological, emotional, or other abuse. \nUnder the statutory definition, both the person who is carrying out the behaviour and the \nperson to whom the behaviour is directed towards must be aged 16 or over and they must \nbe “personally connected” (as defined in section 2 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021). The \ndefinition ensures that different types of relationships are captured, including ex-partners \nand family members. \nAll children can experience and be adversely affected by domestic abuse in the context of \ntheir home life where domestic abuse occurs between family members, including where \nthose being abusive do not live with the child. Experiencing domestic abuse can have a \nsignificant impact on children. Section 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 recognises the \nimpact of domestic abuse on children (0 to 18), as victims in their own right, if they see, \nhear or experience the effects of abuse.\nYoung people can also experience domestic abuse within their own intimate relationships. \nThis form of child-on-child abuse is sometimes referred to as teenage relationship abuse. \nDepending on the age of the young people, this may not be recognised in law under the \nstatutory definition of domestic abuse (if one or both parties are under 16). However, as \nwith any child under 18, where there are concerns about safety or welfare, child \nsafeguarding procedures should be followed and both young victims and young \nperpetrators should be offered support.\n234 Serious Violence Strategy\n235 Criminal exploitation of children and vulnerable adults: county lines guidance (Home Office)\n236 Domestic Abuse Act 2021\n",

This guidance provides further information about the different \nforms of domestic abuse (including teenage relationship abuse and child to parent abuse) \nand the impact of domestic abuse on children.\nEducation, health and care (EHC) plan - An education, health and care (EHC) plan \ndetails the education, health and social care support that is to be provided to a child or \nyoung person who has SEN. See the Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of \nPractice 0-25 (2015).\nEmotional abuse - The persistent emotional maltreatment of a child so as to cause \nsevere and persistent adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may \ninvolve conveying to a child that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only \ninsofar as they meet the needs of another person. It may include not giving the child \nopportunities to express their views, deliberately silencing them, or making fun of what \nthey say or how they communicate. It may feature age or developmentally inappropriate \nexpectations being imposed on children. These may include interactions that are beyond \na child’s developmental capability, as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration \nand learning, or preventing the child participating in normal social interaction. It may \ninvolve seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another. It may involve serious bullying \n(including cyber bullying), causing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger, or \nthe exploitation or corruption of children. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all \ntypes of maltreatment of a child, though it may occur alone.\nExtra-familial harm - Children may be at risk of or experiencing physical, sexual, or \nemotional abuse and exploitation in contexts outside their families (see glossary definition \nof extra-familial contexts). \nWhile there is no legal definition for the term extra-familial harm, it is widely used to \ndescribe different forms of harm that occur outside the home. \nChildren can be vulnerable to multiple forms of extra-familial harm from both adults and/or \nother children. Examples of extra-familial harm may include (but are not limited to): \ncriminal exploitation (such as county lines and financial exploitation), serious violence, \nmodern slavery and trafficking, online harm, sexual exploitation, child-on-child (non\u0002familial) sexual abuse and other forms of harmful sexual behaviour displayed by children \ntowards their peers, abuse, and/or coercive control, children may experience in their own\nintimate relationships (sometimes called teenage relationship abuse), and the influences \nof extremism which could lead to radicalisation.\n237 Domestic Abuse Act 2021: statutory guidance\n",

These can include peer groups, school, and \ncommunity/public spaces, including known places in the community where there are \nconcerns about risks to children (for example, parks, housing estates, shopping centres, \ntakeaway restaurants, or transport hubs), as well as online, including social media or \ngaming platforms.\nExtremism - Extremism is defined in the Prevent strategy as the vocal or active \nopposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual \nliberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs. We also include in \nour definition of extremism calls for the death of members of our armed forces.\nFamily group decision making - this is the umbrella term for family-led decision-making\nforums, where a family network has all the resources, adequate preparation, relevant \ninformation, a safe and appropriate environment, and private family time to make a plan to \nresponse to concerns about a child’s safety or wellbeing. At pre-proceedings stage, \nsuccessful family group decision-making also includes having an independent \ncoordinator. Family group decision-making can take different forms. The Department for \nEducation does not prescribe a specific model, but a process which follows the steps set \nout above. \nFamily group conference - this is one model of family group decision-making.\nFamily network - A group of people close to a child made up of relatives and non\u0002related connected people (where connected people has the same definition used in \nthe Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010238 in \naddition to close family friends who have a connection with the child)\nA family network could include step-parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, \ngrandparents, godparents, or close family friends. \nFinancial exploitation - Financial exploitation can take many forms. In this context, we \nuse the term to describe exploitation which takes place for the purpose of money \nlaundering. This is when criminals target children and adults and take advantage of an \nimbalance of power to coerce, control, manipulate or deceive them into facilitating the \nmovement of illicit funds. This can include physical cash and/or payments through \nfinancial products, such as bank and cryptocurrency accounts. \nKinship care - Kinship care is any situation in which a child is being raised in the care of \na friend or family member who is not their parent. The arrangement may be temporary or \nlonger term. \n238 The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulation 24\n",
