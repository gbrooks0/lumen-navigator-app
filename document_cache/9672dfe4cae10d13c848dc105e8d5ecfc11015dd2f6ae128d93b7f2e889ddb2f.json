For colleges, the guidance relates to their \nresponsibilities towards children who are receiving education or training at these \ninstitutions.\nVictims and alleged perpetrator(s)\nFor the purposes of this guidance, we, in places, use the term ‘victim’. It is a widely \nrecognised and understood term. It is important that schools and colleges recognise that \nnot everyone who has been subjected to abuse considers themselves a victim or would \nwant to be described in this way. Ultimately, schools and colleges should be conscious of \nthis when managing any incident and be prepared to use any term with which the child is \nmost comfortable.\nFor the purpose of this guidance, we, in places, use the term ‘alleged perpetrator(s)’ \nand where appropriate ‘perpetrator(s)’. These are widely used and recognised terms \nand the most appropriate to aid effective drafting of guidance. However, schools and \ncolleges should think very carefully about terminology, especially when speaking in front \nof children, not least because in some cases the abusive behaviour will have been \nharmful to the perpetrator as well. As above, the use of appropriate terminology will be \nfor schools and colleges to determine, as appropriate, on a case-by-case basis. \nWho this guidance is for\nThis statutory guidance should be read and followed by:\n• governing bodies of maintained schools (including maintained nursery schools) \nand colleges which includes providers of post-16 Education as set out in the \nApprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (as amended): 16-19 \nAcademies, Special Post-16 institutions and Independent Training Providers\n• proprietors of independent schools (including academies, free schools and \nalternative provision academies) and non-maintained special schools. In the case \nof academies, free schools and alternative provision academies, the proprietor will \nbe the academy trust\n• management committees of pupil referral units (PRUs), and\n• senior leadership teams\nThroughout the guidance, reference to ‘governing bodies and proprietors’ includes \nmanagement committees unless otherwise stated.\n",

    "page_content": "7 \nPart one: Safeguarding information for all staff\nWhat school and college staff should know and do\nA child centred and co-ordinated approach to safeguarding\n1. Schools and colleges and their staff are an important part of the wider \nsafeguarding system for children. This system is described in the statutory \nguidance Working Together to Safeguard Children. \n2. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is everyone’s \nresponsibility. ‘Children’ includes everyone under the age of 18. Everyone who \ncomes into contact with children and their families has a role to play. In order to fulfil \nthis responsibility effectively, all practitioners should make sure their approach is \nchild centred. This means that they should consider, at all times, what is in the best \ninterests of the child.\n3. No single practitioner can have a full picture of a child’s needs and \ncircumstances. If children and families are to receive the right help at the right time, \neveryone who comes into contact with them has a role to play in identifying \nconcerns, sharing information and taking prompt action. Safeguarding and \npromoting the welfare of children is defined for the purposes of this guidance as:\n• providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems \nemerge\n• protecting children from maltreatment, whether that is within or outside the \nhome, including online\n• preventing the impairment of children’s mental and physical health or \ndevelopment\n• ensuring that children grow up in circumstances consistent with the provision of \nsafe and effective care\n• taking action to enable all children to have the best outcomes \nThe role of school and college staff\n4. School and college staff are particularly important, as they are in a position \nto identify concerns early, provide help for children, promote children’s welfare and \nprevent concerns from escalating.\n5. All staff have a responsibility to provide a safe environment in which children \ncan learn.\n",

All staff should be prepared to identify children who may benefit from early \nhelp.\n4 Early help means providing support as soon as a problem emerges at any \npoint in a child’s life, from the foundation years through to the teenage years.\n7. Any staff member who has any concerns about a child’s welfare should \nfollow the processes set out in paragraphs 49-55. Staff should expect to support \nsocial workers and other agencies following any referral.\n8. Every school and college should have a designated safeguarding lead who \nwill provide support to staff to carry out their safeguarding duties and who will liaise \nclosely with other services such as local authority children’s social care. \n9. The designated safeguarding lead (and any deputies) are most likely to have \na complete safeguarding picture and be the most appropriate person to advise on \nthe response to safeguarding concerns.\n10. The Teachers’ Standards 2012 state that teachers (which includes \nheadteachers) should safeguard children’s wellbeing and maintain public trust in \nthe teaching profession as part of their professional duties.\n5\nWhat school and college staff need to know\n11. All staff should be aware of systems within their school or college which \nsupport safeguarding, and these should be explained to them as part of staff \ninduction. This should include the:\n• child protection policy (which should amongst other things also include the\npolicy and procedures to deal with child-on-child abuse) \n• behaviour policy (which should include measures to prevent bullying, \nincluding cyberbullying, prejudice-based and discriminatory bullying).6\n• staff behaviour policy (sometimes called a code of conduct) should amongst \nother things, include low-level concerns, allegations against staff and \nwhistleblowing\n• safeguarding response to children who are absent from education, \nparticularly on repeat occasions and/or prolonged periods \n4 Detailed information on early help can be found in Working Together to Safeguard Children. 5 Teachers' standards. 6 All schools are required to have a behaviour policy (full details are here). If a college chooses to have a \nbehaviour policy it should be provided to staff as described above.\n",

In addition, all staff should receive safeguarding and child \nprotection (including online safety) updates (for example, via email, e-bulletins, and \nstaff meetings), as required, and at least annually, to continue to provide them with \nrelevant skills and knowledge to safeguard children effectively.\n13. All staff should be aware of their local early help process and understand \ntheir role in it.\n14. All staff should be aware of the process for making referrals to local authority \nchildren’s social care and for statutory assessments.\n7 under the Children Act 1989, \nespecially section 17 (children in need) and section 47 (a child suffering, or likely to \nsuffer, significant harm) that may follow a referral, along with the role they might be \nexpected to play in such assessments. \n15. All staff should know what to do if a child tells them they are being abused, \nexploited, or neglected. Staff should know how to manage the requirement to \nmaintain an appropriate level of confidentiality. This means only involving those \nwho need to be involved, such as the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) \nand local authority children’s social care. Staff should never promise a child that \nthey will not tell anyone about a report of any form of abuse, as this may ultimately \nnot be in the best interests of the child.\n16. All staff should be able to reassure victims that they are being taken \nseriously and that they will be supported and kept safe. A victim should never be \ngiven the impression that they are creating a problem by reporting any form of \nabuse and/or neglect. Nor should a victim ever be made to feel ashamed for \nmaking a report. \n17. All staff should be aware that children may not feel ready or know how to tell \nsomeone that they are being abused, exploited, or neglected, and/or they may not \n7 Detailed information on statutory assessments can be found in Working Together to Safeguard Children\n",

All staff should be aware of the indicators of abuse, neglect and exploitation \n(see below), understanding that children can be at risk of harm inside and outside \nof the school/college, inside and outside of home, and online. Exercising\nprofessional curiosity and knowing what to look for is vital for the early identification \nof abuse and neglect so that staff are able to identify cases of children who may be \nin need of help or protection.\n20. All school and college staff should be aware that abuse, neglect, \nexploitation, and safeguarding issues are rarely standalone events and cannot be \ncovered by one definition or one label alone. In most cases, multiple issues will \noverlap. \n21. All staff, but especially the designated safeguarding lead (and deputies) \nshould consider whether children are at risk of abuse or exploitation in situations \noutside their families. Extra familial harms take a variety of different forms and \nchildren can be vulnerable to multiple harms including (but not limited to) sexual \nabuse (including harassment and exploitation), domestic abuse in their own \nintimate relationships (teenage relationship abuse), criminal exploitation, serious \nyouth violence, county lines and radicalisation. \n22. All staff should be aware that technology is a significant component in many \nsafeguarding and wellbeing issues. Children are at risk of abuse and other risks\nonline as well as face to face. In many cases abuse and other risks will take place \nconcurrently both online and offline. Children can also abuse other children online, \nthis can take the form of abusive, harassing, and misogynistic/misandrist\nmessages, the non-consensual sharing of indecent images, especially around chat \ngroups, and the sharing of abusive images and pornography to those who do not \nwant to receive such content.\n23. In all cases, if staff are unsure, they should always speak to the \ndesignated safeguarding lead or a deputy. \nIndicators of abuse and neglect\n24. Abuse: a form of maltreatment of a child. Somebody may abuse or neglect a \nchild by inflicting harm or by failing to act to prevent harm. Harm can include ill \ntreatment that is not physical as well as the impact of witnessing ill treatment of \nothers. This can be particularly relevant, for example, in relation to the impact on \nchildren of all forms of domestic abuse, including where they see, hear or \nexperience its effects. Children may be abused in a family or in an institutional or \ncommunity setting by those known to them or, more rarely, by others. Abuse can\n",

Physical abuse: a form of abuse which may involve hitting, shaking, \nthrowing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating or otherwise \ncausing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may also be caused when a parent \nor carer fabricates the symptoms of, or deliberately induces, illness in a child.\n26. Emotional abuse: the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child such as \nto cause severe and adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may \ninvolve conveying to a child that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or \nvalued only insofar as they meet the needs of another person. It may include not \ngiving the child opportunities to express their views, deliberately silencing them or \n‘making fun’ of what they say or how they communicate. It may feature age or \ndevelopmentally inappropriate expectations being imposed on children. These may \ninclude interactions that are beyond a child’s developmental capability as well as \noverprotection and limitation of exploration and learning or preventing the child from \nparticipating in normal social interaction. It may involve seeing or hearing the ill\u0002treatment of another. It may involve serious bullying (including cyberbullying), \ncausing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger, or the exploitation or \ncorruption of children. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of \nmaltreatment of a child, although it may occur alone.\n27. Sexual abuse: involves forcing or enticing a child or young person to take \npart in sexual activities, not necessarily involving violence, whether or not the child \nis aware of what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, \nincluding assault by penetration (for example rape or oral sex) or non-penetrative \nacts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing, and touching outside of clothing. They \nmay also include non-contact activities, such as involving children in looking at, or \nin the production of, sexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging \nchildren to behave in sexually inappropriate ways, or grooming a child in \npreparation for abuse. Sexual abuse can take place online, and technology can be \nused to facilitate offline abuse. Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult \nmales. Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children. The \nsexual abuse of children by other children is a specific safeguarding issue in \neducation and all staff should be aware of it and of their school or college’s policy \nand procedures for dealing with it. \n28. Neglect: the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or \npsychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health \nor development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy, for example, as a result of \nmaternal substance abuse. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or \ncarer failing to: provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion\n",

All staff should understand that even if there are no reports in their schools \nor colleges it does not mean it is not happening. It may be the case that abuse is \nnot being reported. As such it is important that when staff have any concerns \nregarding child-on-child abuse they should speak to their designated safeguarding \nlead (or a deputy).\n32. It is essential that all staff understand the importance of challenging \ninappropriate behaviours between children that are abusive in nature. Examples of \nwhich are listed below. Downplaying certain behaviours, for example dismissing \nsexual harassment as “just banter”, “just having a laugh”, “part of growing up” or \n“boys being boys” can lead to a culture of unacceptable behaviours, an unsafe \n8 Consensual image sharing, especially between older children of the same age, may require a different \nresponse.

Both CCE and CSE are forms of abuse that occur where an individual or \ngroup takes advantage of an imbalance in power to coerce, manipulate or deceive \na child into taking part in criminal or sexual activity. It may involve an exchange for \nsomething the victim needs or wants, and/or for the financial advantage or \nincreased status of the perpetrator or facilitator and/or through violence or the \nthreat of violence. CCE and CSE can affect children, both male and female and can \ninclude children who have been moved (commonly referred to as trafficking) for the \npurpose of exploitation.\nChild criminal exploitation (CCE)13\n35. Some specific forms of CCE can include children being forced or \nmanipulated into transporting drugs or money through county lines, working in \ncannabis factories, shoplifting or pickpocketing. They can also be forced or \nmanipulated into committing vehicle crime or threatening/committing serious \nviolence to others. \n36. Children can become trapped by this type of exploitation, as perpetrators \ncan threaten victims (and their families) with violence or entrap and coerce them \ninto debt. They may be coerced into carrying weapons such as knives or begin to \ncarry a knife for a sense of protection from harm from others. As children involved \nin criminal exploitation often commit crimes themselves, their vulnerability as \nvictims is not always recognised by adults and professionals, (particularly older \nchildren), and they are not treated as victims despite the harm they have \nexperienced. They may still have been criminally exploited even if the activity \nappears to be something they have agreed or consented to. \n37. It is important to note that the experience of girls who are criminally exploited \ncan be very different to that of boys. The indicators may not be the same, however \nprofessionals should be aware that girls are at risk of criminal exploitation too. It is \nalso important to note that both boys and girls being criminally exploited may be at \nhigher risk of sexual exploitation.\nChild sexual exploitation (CSE)\n38. CSE is a form of child sexual abuse. Sexual abuse may involve physical \ncontact, including assault by penetration (for example, rape or oral sex) or non\u0002penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing, and touching outside \n13 See information on CCE definition on page 48 of Home Office's Serious Violence Strategy\n",

It may include non-contact activities, such as involving children in the \nproduction of sexual images, forcing children to look at sexual images or watch \nsexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually inappropriate ways or \ngrooming a child in preparation for abuse including via the internet.\n39. CSE can occur over time or be a one-off occurrence and may happen \nwithout the child’s immediate knowledge for example through others sharing videos \nor images of them on social media.\n40. CSE can affect any child who has been coerced into engaging in sexual \nactivities. This includes 16 and 17-year-olds who can legally consent to have sex. \nSome children do not realise they are being exploited and may believe they are in a \ngenuine romantic relationship. \nDomestic abuse\n41. Domestic abuse can encompass a wide range of behaviours and may be a \nsingle incident or a pattern of incidents. That abuse can be, but is not limited to, \npsychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional. Children can be victims of \ndomestic abuse. They may see, hear, or experience the effects of abuse at home \nand/or suffer domestic abuse in their own intimate relationships (teenage \nrelationship abuse). All of which can have a detrimental and long-term impact on \ntheir health, well-being, development, and ability to learn.\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM)\n42. Whilst all staff should speak to the designated safeguarding lead (or a \ndeputy) with regard to any concerns about female genital mutilation (FGM), there is \na specific legal duty on teachers.\n14 If a teacher, in the course of their work in the \nprofession, discovers that an act of FGM appears to have been carried out on a girl \nunder the age of 18, the teacher must report this to the police. See page 161 for\nfurther information.\nMental health\n43. All staff should be aware that mental health problems can, in some cases, \nbe an indicator that a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering abuse, neglect or \nexploitation.\n14 Under section 5B(11) (a) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, “teacher” means, in relation to \nEngland, a person within section 141A(1) of the Education Act 2002 (persons employed or engaged to \ncarry out teaching work at schools and other institutions in England).\n",

Education staff, however, are well placed to observe \nchildren day-to-day and identify those whose behaviour suggests that they may be \nexperiencing a mental health problem or be at risk of developing one. Schools and \ncolleges can access a range of advice to help them identify children in need of \nextra mental health support, this includes working with external agencies.\n45. If staff have a mental health concern about a child that is also a safeguarding \nconcern, immediate action should be taken to follow their school or college’s child \nprotection policy and by speaking to the designated safeguarding lead or a deputy.\nSerious violence\n46. All staff should be aware of the indicators, which may signal children are at \nrisk from, or are involved with, serious violent crime. These may include increased \nabsence from school or college, a change in friendships or relationships with older \nindividuals or groups, a significant decline in educational performance, signs of self\u0002harm or a significant change in wellbeing, or signs of assault or unexplained \ninjuries. Unexplained gifts or new possessions could also indicate that children \nhave been approached by, or are involved with, individuals associated with criminal \nnetworks or gangs and may be at risk of criminal exploitation. \nAdditional information and support \n47. Departmental advice What to do if you're worried a child is being abused: advice \nfor practitioners provides more information on understanding and identifying abuse and \nneglect. Examples of potential indicators of abuse and neglect are highlighted throughout \nthat advice and will be particularly helpful for school and college staff. The NSPCC\nwebsite also provides useful additional information on abuse and neglect and what to \nlook out for. \n48. Annex B contains important additional information about specific \nforms of abuse, exploitation and safeguarding issues. School and college \nleaders and those staff who work directly with children should read Annex B.\nWhat school and college staff should do if they have concerns \nabout a child\n49. Staff working with children are advised to maintain an attitude of ‘it could \nhappen here’ where safeguarding is concerned. When concerned about the \nwelfare of a child, staff should always act in the best interests of the child.\n",

The designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) should always be available \nto discuss safeguarding concerns. If in exceptional circumstances, the designated \nsafeguarding lead (or a deputy) is not available, this should not delay appropriate \naction being taken.

In \nthese circumstances, any action taken should be shared with the designated \nsafeguarding lead (or a deputy) as soon as is practically possible.\n54. Staff should not assume a colleague, or another professional will take action \nand share information that might be critical in keeping children safe. They should \nbe mindful that early information sharing is vital for the effective identification, \nassessment, and allocation of appropriate service provision, whether this is when \nproblems first emerge, or where a child is already known to local authority \nchildren’s social care (such as a child in need or a child with a protection plan). \nInformation sharing: advice for practitioners providing safeguarding services to \nchildren, young people, parents and carers supports staff who have to make \ndecisions about sharing information. This advice includes the seven golden rules \n15 Further information on early help assessments, provision of early help services and accessing services is \nin Working Together to Safeguard Children. 16 Working Together to Safeguard Children sets out that the safeguarding partners should publish a \nthreshold document that should include the criteria, including the level of need, for when a case should be \nreferred to local authority children’s social care for assessment and for statutory services under section 17 \nand 47. Local authorities, with their partners, should develop and publish local protocols for assessment.

DPA and UK GDPR do not prevent the sharing of information for the \npurposes of keeping children safe and promoting their welfare. If in any doubt \nabout sharing information, staff should speak to the designated safeguarding lead \n(or a deputy). Fears about sharing information must not be allowed to stand in the \nway of the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.\nEarly help assessment\n56. If early help is appropriate, the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) \nwill generally lead on liaising with other agencies and setting up an inter-agency \nassessment as appropriate. Staff may be required to support other agencies and \nprofessionals in an early help assessment, in some cases acting as the lead \npractitioner. Further guidance on effective assessment of the need for early help \ncan be found in Working Together to Safeguard Children. Any such cases should \nbe kept under constant review and consideration given to a referral to local \nauthority children’s social care for assessment for statutory services if the child’s \nsituation does not appear to be improving or is getting worse.\nStatutory children’s social care assessments and services\n57. Where a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer from harm, it is \nimportant that a referral to local authority children’s social care and if \nappropriate the police, (see when to call the police: guidance for schools and \ncolleges (npcc.police.uk)) is made immediately. Referrals should follow the local \nreferral process. \n58. Local authority children’s social care assessments should consider where \nchildren are being harmed in contexts outside of the home17, so it is important that \nschools and colleges provide as much information as possible as part of the referral \nprocess. This will allow any assessment to consider all the available evidence and \nenable a contextual approach to address such harm. Additional information is \navailable here: Contextual Safeguarding.\n59.

Children in need may be assessed under section 17 \nof the Children Act 1989. Under section 47 of the Children Act 1989, where a local authority has \nreasonable cause to suspect that a child is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm, it has a duty to \nmake enquiries to decide whether to take action to safeguard or promote the child’s welfare.

This part of the guidance sets out the responsibility of governing bodies, \nproprietors and management committees. \nLegislation and the law\n76. Governing bodies and proprietors20 have a strategic leadership responsibility \nfor their school or college’s safeguarding arrangements and must ensure that they \ncomply with their duties under legislation. They must have regard to this guidance, \nensuring policies, procedures and training in their schools or colleges are effective \nand comply with the law at all times.21 Headteachers and principals should ensure \nthat the policies and procedures, adopted by their governing bodies and proprietors \n(particularly those concerning referrals of cases of suspected abuse and neglect), \nare understood, and followed by all staff. \n77. Where a school or college has charitable status, Charity Commission \nguidance on charity and trustee duties to safeguard children is available at \nGOV.UK.\n78. Governing bodies and proprietors should have a senior board level (or \nequivalent) lead to take leadership responsibility for their school or college’s \nsafeguarding arrangements22. \n20 In the case of academies, free schools and alternative provision academies the proprietor will be the \nacademy trust.\n21 Section 175 of the Education Act 2002 requires governing bodies of maintained schools and colleges, in \nrelation to their functions relating to the conduct of the school or the institution to make arrangements for \nensuring that such functions are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of \nchildren who are either pupils at the school or are receiving education or training at the institution. The \nEducation (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 apply a duty to proprietors of independent \nschools (which in the case of academies and free schools is the academy trust) to ensure that \narrangements are made to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The Non-Maintained Special \nSchools (England) Regulations 2015 oblige non-maintained special schools to comply with certain \nrequirements as a condition of their approval and whilst approved by the Secretary of State. One condition \nof approval is that the proprietor must make arrangements for safeguarding and promoting the health, \nsafety and welfare of pupils, which have regard to any guidance including where appropriate, the National \nMinimum Standards, about safeguarding and promoting the health, safety and welfare of pupils and, in the \ncase of schools already approved, that these arrangements at the school with respect to these matters are \nin accordance with the approval given by the Secretary of State. The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and \nLearning Act 2009 (as amended) requires 16-19 Academies, Special Post-16 institutions and Independent \nTraining Providers to make arrangements to ensure that the proprietor's functions relating to the conduct of \nthe institution are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children receiving \neducation or training at the institution. For colleges, non-maintained special schools and independent \nschools: the definition of ‘children’ applies to the statutory responsibilities for safeguarding and promoting \nthe welfare of children i.e. those under 18.\n22 Working Together to Safeguard Children.\n",

Whilst all of the above protections are important in the context of \nsafeguarding, this guidance and the legal duties placed on schools and colleges, in \nrelation to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, governing bodies \nand proprietors should carefully consider how they are supporting their pupils and \nstudents with regard to particular protected characteristics - including disability, sex, \nsexual orientation, gender reassignment and race.\n87. Provisions within the Equality Act allow schools and colleges to take positive \naction, where it can be shown that it is proportionate, to deal with particular \ndisadvantages affecting pupils or students with certain protected characteristics in \norder to meet their specific need. A school or college, could, for example, consider \ntaking positive action to support girls if there was evidence that they were being\ndisproportionately subjected to sexual violence or sexual harassment.

(More information is provided at paragraph 177).\n99. The above is not intended to be an exhaustive list. These policies and \nprocedures, along with Part one (or Annex A if appropriate) of this guidance and \ninformation regarding the role and identity of the designated safeguarding lead (and \ndeputies), should be provided to all staff on induction.\n100. Governing bodies and proprietors should take a proportionate risk-based \napproach to the level of information that is provided to temporary staff, volunteers\nand contractors. \n101. In addition, governing bodies and proprietors should ensure:\n• child protection files are maintained as set out in Annex C \n• appropriate safer recruitment policies in accordance with Part three of \nthis guidance are in place, embedded and effective and, \n• where reasonably possible, schools and colleges hold more than one \nemergency contact number for each pupil or student. This goes beyond \nthe legal minimum.\n30 It is good practice to give the school or college \nadditional options to make contact with a responsible adult when a child \nmissing education is also identified as a welfare and/or safeguarding \nconcern. Further information for schools can be found in the department’s \nstatutory guidance ‘Working together to improve school attendance ’. \n28 All schools are required to have a behaviour policy (full details are here). If a college chooses to have a \nbehaviour policy, it should be provided to staff at induction as described above.\n29 When drafting the staff behaviour policy, schools and colleges should bear in mind the offence under \nsection 16 of The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which provides that it is an offence for a person aged 18 or \nover (e.g. teacher, youth worker) to have a sexual relationship with a child under 18 where that person is in \na position of trust in respect of that child, even if the relationship is consensual. A situation where a person \nis in a position of trust could arise where the child is in full-time education and the person looks after \nchildren under 18 in the same establishment as the child, even if they do not teach the child.\n30 See The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006, available at legislation.gov.uk.\n",

Working Together to Safeguard Children is very clear that all schools \n(including those in multi-academy trusts) and colleges in the local area should be \nfully engaged, involved, and included in safeguarding arrangements. It is expected \nthat, locally, the safeguarding partners will name schools and colleges as relevant \nagencies.

Schools and colleges are included.\n33 The safeguarding partners should publish a document which sets out the local criteria for action in a way \nthat is transparent, accessible and easily understood. This should include: the process for the early help \nassessment and the type and level of early help services to be provided; the criteria, included level of need, \nfor when a case should be referred to local authority children’s social care for assessment and for statutory \nservices under section 17, 20, 31 and 47 of the Children Act 1989; and clear procedures and processes for \ncases relating to the exploitation of children, children managed within the youth secure estate and disabled \nchildren.\n34 The local authority, with their partners should develop and publish local protocols for assessment. \nProtocols should set out clear arrangements for how cases will be managed once a referral is made to local \nauthority children’s social care.\n35 More details on information requests by the safeguarding partners is provided in Working Together to \nSafeguard Children.\n",

Whilst considering their responsibility to safeguard and promote the welfare \nof children and provide them with a safe environment in which to learn, governing \nbodies and proprietors should be doing all that they reasonably can to limit \nchildren’s exposure to the above risks from the school or college’s IT system. As \npart of this process, governing bodies and proprietors should ensure their school or \ncollege has appropriate filtering and monitoring systems in place and regularly \nreview their effectiveness. They should ensure that the leadership team and \nrelevant staff have an awareness and understanding of the provisions in place and\nmanage them effectively and know how to escalate concerns when identified. \nGoverning bodies and proprietors should consider the number of and age range of \ntheir children, those who are potentially at greater risk of harm and how often they \naccess the IT system along with the proportionality of costs versus safeguarding \nrisks. \n141. The appropriateness of any filtering and monitoring systems are a matter for \nindividual schools and colleges and will be informed in part, by the risk assessment \nrequired by the Prevent Duty.41\n142. The Department for Education’s filtering and monitoring standards set out \nthat schools and colleges should:\n• identify and assign roles and responsibilities to manage filtering and monitoring \nsystems. \n• review filtering and monitoring provision at least annually. \n• block harmful and inappropriate content without unreasonably impacting teaching \nand learning.\n• have effective monitoring strategies in place that meet their safeguarding needs. \n• schools can use the department’s ‘plan technology for your school service’ to self\u0002assess against the filtering and monitoring standards and receive personalised \nrecommendations on how to meet them. \n143. Governing bodies and proprietors should review the standards and discuss \nwith IT staff and service providers what more needs to be done to support schools \nand colleges in meeting this standard. Additional guidance on “appropriate” filtering \nand monitoring can be found at: \n41 The Prevent duty Departmental advice for schools and childcare providers and Home Office Statutory \nguidance: Prevent duty guidance.\n",

The use of force \nmay involve either passive physical contact, such as standing between pupils or \nblocking a pupil’s path, or active physical contact such as leading a pupil by the \narm out of the classroom.\n164. The department believes that the adoption of a ‘no contact’ policy at a school \nor college can leave staff unable to fully support and protect their pupils and \nstudents. The department therefore encourages principals, governing bodies, and \nproprietors to adopt sensible policies, which allow and support their staff to make \nappropriate physical contact. The decision on whether or not to use ‘reasonable \nforce’ to control or restrain a child is down to the professional judgement of the staff \nconcerned within the context of the law and should always depend on individual \ncircumstances. \n165. When using ‘reasonable force’ in response to risks presented by incidents \ninvolving children with SEND, mental health problems or with medical conditions, \nschools and colleges should in considering the risks carefully recognise the \nadditional vulnerability of these groups. They should also consider their duties \nunder the Equality Act 2010 (see paragraphs 84-91), for example in relation to \nmaking reasonable adjustments and their Public Sector Equality Duty. By planning \npositive and proactive behaviour support, for instance through drawing up individual \nbehaviour plans for more vulnerable children, and agreeing them with parents and \ncarers, schools and colleges can reduce the occurrence of challenging behaviour \nand the need to use ‘reasonable force’. \n• Departmental advice for schools is available at Use of Reasonable Force in \nSchools\n• HM Government guidance Reducing the need for restraint and restrictive \nintervention sets out how to support children and young people with learning \ndisabilities, autistic spectrum conditions and mental health difficulties who are \nat risk of restrictive intervention in special education settings, however all \nschools and colleges may find the information helpful.\nUse of school or college premises for non-school/college activities\n166. Where governing bodies or proprietors hire or rent out school or college \nfacilities/premises to organisations or individuals (for example to community \ngroups, sports associations, and service providers to run community or extra\u0002curricular activities) they should ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place \nto keep children safe.\n",

When services or activities are provided by the governing body or proprietor, \nunder the direct supervision or management of their school or college staff, their \narrangements for child protection will apply. However, where services or activities \nare provided separately by another body this is not necessarily the case. The \ngoverning body or proprietor should therefore seek assurance that the provider \nconcerned has appropriate safeguarding and child protection policies and \nprocedures in place (including inspecting these as needed); and ensure that there \nare arrangements in place for the provider to liaise with the school or college on \nthese matters where appropriate. This applies regardless of whether or not the \nchildren who attend any of these services or activities are children on the school roll \nor attend the college. The governing body or proprietor should also ensure \nsafeguarding requirements are included in any transfer of control agreement (i.e. \nlease or hire agreement), as a condition of use and occupation of the premises; \nand that failure to comply with this would lead to termination of the agreement.

The cohort of pupils in Alternative Provision often have complex needs, it is \nimportant that governing bodies and proprietors of these settings are aware of the \nadditional risk of harm that their pupils may be vulnerable to. Schools should obtain \nwritten information from the alternative provider that appropriate safeguarding \nchecks have been carried out on individuals working at their establishment (i.e.\nthose checks that schools would otherwise perform on their own staff). This \nincludes written confirmation that the alternative provider will inform the \ncommissioning school of any arrangements that may put the child at risk (i.e. staff \nchanges), so that the commissioning school can ensure itself that appropriate \nsafeguarding checks have been carried out on new staff. \n170. Schools should always know where a child is based during school hours. \nThis includes having records of the address of the alternative provider and any \nsubcontracted provision or satellite sites the child may attend. They should \nregularly review the alternative provision placements they make.

Where a parent/carer has expressed their intention to remove a child from \nschool with a view to educating at home, we recommend that local authorities, \nschools, and other key professionals work together to coordinate a meeting with \nparents/carers where possible. This would be before a final decision has been \nmade, to ensure the parents/carers have considered what is in the best interests of \neach child.

We are aware most schools and colleges \nalready have a senior mental health lead in place.\n186. Schools and colleges can access a training grant to pay for DfE quality \nassured senior mental health lead training, helping them to implement a holistic \n‘whole school or college’ approach to mental health and wellbeing. Further \ninformation on how schools and colleges can apply for a grant and identify the most \nappropriate training for them – can be found at Guidance: Senior mental health \nlead training. \n187. In addition, Public Health England47 has produced a range of resources to \nsupport secondary schools to promote positive health, wellbeing and resilience \namong children including its guidance Promoting children and young people’s \nemotional health and wellbeing. Its resources include social media, forming positive \nrelationships, smoking, and alcohol. See Rise Above: Resources for School from \nPublic Health England, from the Education People, which has links to all materials \nand lesson plans. The department has also published, ‘Every interaction matters’ a \npre-recorded webinar which provides staff with a simple framework for promoting \nwellbeing, resilience, and mental health. This sits alongside our Wellbeing for \neducation recovery program content, which covers issues such as bereavement, \nloss, anxiety, stress and trauma.\n188. The department has published advice and guidance on Preventing bullying\n(which may also be useful for colleges). The Promoting and supporting mental \nhealth and wellbeing in schools and colleges guidance sets out how schools and \ncolleges can help prevent mental health problems by promoting resilience as part \nof an integrated, whole school/college approach to social and emotional wellbeing, \nwhich is tailored to the needs of their pupils and students. \n47 Public Health England: has now been replaced by the UK Health Security Agency and the Office for \nHealth Improvement and Disparities (OHID), which is part of the Department of Health and Social Care, \nand by the UK Health Security Agency.

If published, we will signpost to this guidance in September 2025. \n \n204. A child or young person being lesbian, gay, or bisexual is not in itself an \ninherent risk factor for harm, however, they can sometimes be targeted by other \nchildren. In some cases, a child who is perceived by other children to be lesbian, \ngay, or bisexual (whether they are or not) can be just as vulnerable as children who \nare.\n205. However, the Cass review identified that caution is necessary for children \nquestioning their gender as there remain many unknowns about the impact of \nsocial transition and children may well have wider vulnerabilities, including having\ncomplex mental health and psychosocial needs, and in some cases additional \ndiagnoses of autism and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. \n206. It recommended that when families/carers are making decisions about \nsupport for gender questioning children, they should be encouraged to seek clinical \nhelp and advice. When parents are supporting pre-pubertal children, clinical \nservices should ensure that they can be seen as early as possible by a clinical \nprofessional with relevant experience.\n207. As such, when supporting a gender questioning child, schools should take a \ncautious approach and consider the broad range of their individual needs, in \npartnership with the child’s parents (other than in the exceptionally rare \ncircumstances where involving parents would constitute a significant risk of harm to \nthe child), including any clinical advice that is available and how to address wider \nvulnerabilities such as the risk of bullying. \n208. Risks can be compounded where children lack trusted adults with whom \nthey can be open. It is therefore vital that staff endeavour to reduce the additional \nbarriers faced and create a culture where they can speak out or share their \nconcerns with members of staff.\n",

This includes:\nc. relevant personal care, or health care provided by or provided under the \nsupervision of a health care professional:\no personal care includes helping a child with eating and drinking for \nreasons of illness or disability or in connection with toileting, washing, \nbathing and dressing for reasons of age, illness of disability; 76\no health care means care for children provided by, or under the direction or \nsupervision of, a regulated health care professional.\nRegulated activity will not be:\n• paid work in specified places which is occasional and temporary and does not \ninvolve teaching, training; and\n• supervised activity which is paid in non-specified settings such as youth clubs, \nsports clubs etc.\n75 The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 provides that the type of work referred to at (a) or (b) will be \nregulated activity if “it is carried out frequently by the same person” or if “the period condition is satisfied”. \nParagraph 10 of Schedule 4 to this Act says the period condition is satisfied if the person carrying out the \nactivity does so at any time on more than three days in any period of 30 days and, for the purposes of the work \nreferred to at (a), apart from driving vehicle only for children, it is also satisfied if it is done at any time between \n2am and 6am and it gives the person the opportunity to have face to face contact with children.\n",

These are the types of checks available.\n• Basic DBS check – this provides details of convictions and conditional \ncautions considered to be ‘unspent’ under the terms of the Rehabilitation of \nOffenders Act 1974.\n• Standard DBS check –this provides information about convictions, cautions, \nreprimands and warnings held on the Police National Computer (PNC), \nregardless or not of whether they are spent under the Rehabilitation of \nOffenders Act 1974. The law allows for certain old and minor matters to be \nfiltered out.\n• Enhanced DBS check – this provides the same information about \nconvictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings held on the Police National \nComputer (PNC) as a Standard DBS check, plus additional information held \nby the police such as interviews and allegations. Additional information will \nonly be disclosed where a chief police officer reasonably believes it to be \nrelevant and considers that it ought to be disclosed. The position being applied \nfor/or activities being undertaken must be covered by an exempted question \nin the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 and by \nprovisions in the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) Regulations 2002.77 \n• Enhanced DBS check with children’s barred list information – where \npeople are working or seeking to work in regulated activity relating to children, \nthis allows an additional check, to be made, about whether the person \nappears on the children’s barred list, along with a check of the Police National \nComputer records plus additional information held by the police as above. The \nposition being applied for, or activities being undertaken, must be eligible for \nan enhanced DBS check as above and be for a purpose listed in the Police \nAct 1997 (Criminal Records) (No2) Regulations 2009 as qualifying for a barred \n76 It is not intended that personal care includes such activities as, for example, parent volunteers helping \nwith costumes for school plays or helping a child lace up football boots.\n77 This legislation does not provide a list of job roles that are eligible for this check – such a list does not \nexist. Instead, The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 sets out the ‘exempted \nquestions’ for which a Standard DBS check can be obtained. Similarly, The Police Act 1997 (Criminal \nRecords) Regulations 2002 set out the purposes for which an Enhanced DBS check can be obtained, \nand The Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) (No 2) Regulations 2009 list the circumstances in which an \napplication for an Enhanced DBS check can also include suitability information relating to children (a \nchildren’s barred list check and confirmation as to whether an individual is subject to a s.128 direction). \nIt is important to note that the Regulations can also remove roles, duties or activities through the \nremoval of an exempted question or of a particular purpose. Any individual (including an applicant for a \njob which does not involve working with children) can be asked to apply for a Basic criminal record \ncheck. This will show only unspent convictions and cautions. Further details can be found on gov.uk.\n",

As good practice, many schools and colleges require new staff to join the \nUpdate Service as part of their employment contract. The benefits of joining the \nUpdate Service are:\n• portability of a DBS check across employers\n• free online checks to identify whether there has been any change to the \ninformation recorded, since the initial certificate was issued and advice \nwhether the individual should apply for a new DBS check, and, \n• that individuals will be able to see a full list of those organisations that have \ncarried out a status check on their account.\n256. Before using the Update Service, schools and colleges must: \n• obtain consent from the individual to carry out an online check to view the \nstatus of an existing standard or enhanced DBS check\n• confirm the DBS certificate matches the individual’s identity\n• examine the original certificate to ensure that it is valid for employment with \nthe children’s workforce, and, \n• ensure that the level of the check is appropriate to the job they are applying \nfor, e.g. enhanced DBS check/enhanced DBS check including with barred list \ninformation.\n257.

Teacher prohibition and interim prohibition orders prevent a person from \ncarrying out teaching work as defined in the Teachers’ Disciplinary (England) \nRegulations 2012 in schools, sixth form colleges, 16-19 academies, relevant youth \naccommodation and children’s homes in England. Further information about the \nduty to consider referring to the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) can be found \nat paragraphs 354-355. Teacher prohibition orders are made by the Secretary of \nState following consideration by a professional conduct panel convened by the \nTRA. Pending such consideration, the Secretary of State may issue an interim \nprohibition order if it is considered to be in the public interest to do so. The TRA’s \nrole in making prohibition orders and the processes used to impose them are \ndescribed in more detail in the publications “Teacher misconduct: disciplinary \nprocedures for the teaching profession” and “Teacher misconduct: the prohibition of \nteachers: Advice on factors relating to decisions leading to the prohibition of \nteachers from the teaching profession”.\n259.

There are a number of individuals who are still subject to disciplinary \nsanctions, which were imposed by the GTCE (prior to its abolition in 2012).

By virtue of their Conditions of Funding in respect of funding received from the Education \nand Skills Funding Agency, colleges may not employ or engage a person who is subject to a prohibition \norder to carry out teaching work.\n81 The School Staffing (England) Regulations 2009, the Non-Maintained Special Schools (England) \nRegulations 2015 and the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 require governing \nbodies or proprietors (of schools and sixth form colleges) to check that a person to be appointed is not \nsubject to an interim prohibition order. By virtue of their Conditions of Funding in respect of funding \nreceived from the Education and Skills Funding Agency, before employing a person to carry out teaching \nwork in relation to children, colleges must take reasonable steps to establish whether that person is subject \nto an interim prohibition order made under section 141B of the Education Act 2002.\n",

A section 128 direction prohibits or restricts an unsuitable individual from \nparticipating in the management of an independent school, including academies \nand free schools. An individual who is subject to a section 128 direction is unable \nto: \n• take up a management position in an independent school, academy, or in a \nfree school as an employee\n• be a trustee of an academy or free school trust; a governor or member of a \nproprietor body of an independent school, or\n• be a governor on any governing body in an independent school, academy or \nfree school that retains or has been delegated any management \nresponsibilities.\n262. There is no exhaustive list of roles that might be regarded as ‘management’ \nfor the purpose of determining what constitutes management in an independent \nschool. The Department’s view is that roles involving, or very likely to involve, \nmanagement of a school include (but are not limited to) headteachers, principals, \ndeputy/assistant headteachers, governors and trustees. It is important to note that \nthe individual’s job title is not the determining factor and whether other individuals \nsuch as teachers with additional responsibilities could be considered to be ‘taking \npart in management’ depends on the facts of the case.82\n263. The grounds on which a section 128 direction may be made by the Secretary \nof State are set out in The Independent Educational Provision in England \n(Prohibition on Participation in Management) Regulations 201483 made under \nsection 128 of the Education and Skills Act 2008.\n264.

Schools and colleges quite often make arrangements for children receiving \neducation at their institution to have learning experiences where, for short periods, \nthe children may be provided with care and accommodation by a host family to \nwhom they are not related. This might happen, for example, as part of a foreign \nexchange visit or sports tour, often described as ‘homestay’ arrangements (see \nAnnex D for further details).\n339. In some circumstances the arrangement where children stay with UK \nfamilies could amount to “private fostering” under the Children Act 1989.\nPrivate fostering – local authority notification when identified\n340. Private fostering123 occurs when a child under the age of 16 (under 18 for \nchildren with a disability) is provided with care and accommodation by a person \nwho is not a parent, person with parental responsibility for them or a relative in their \nown home.\n341. A child is not privately fostered if the person caring for and accommodating \nthem has done so for less than 28 days and does not intend to do so for longer. \nSuch arrangements may come to the attention of school and college staff through \nthe normal course of their interaction, and promotion of learning activities, with \nchildren.\n342. Where the arrangements come to the attention of the school or college (and \nthe school or college is not involved in the arrangements), they should then notify \nthe local authority to allow the local authority to check the arrangement is suitable \nand safe for the child. Schools and colleges who are involved (whether or not \ndirectly) in arranging for a child to be fostered privately must notify local authorities \nof the arrangement as soon as possible after the arrangement has been made. \nNotifications must contain the information specified in Schedule 1 of The Children \n(Private Arrangements for Fostering) Regulations 2005 and must be made in \nwriting.\nDBS Guidance leaflets\n122 Under the Police Act 1997, an individual must be 16 or over to be able to make an application for a DBS \ncheck.\n123 Part 9 of the Children Act 1989 (legislation.gov.uk).\n",

How to ensure the ongoing safeguarding of children and \nthe legal reporting duties on employers\n344. This section explains the importance of safeguarding vigilance beyond the \nrecruitment process and as part of the whole school or college approach to \nsafeguarding. \n345. Safer recruitment is not just about carrying out the right DBS checks. \nSimilarly safeguarding should not be limited to recruitment procedures. Good \nsafeguarding requires a continuing commitment from governing bodies, proprietors, \nand all staff to ensure the safety and welfare of children is embedded in all of the \norganisation’s processes and procedures and consequentially enshrined in its \nethos. See Parts one and two of this guidance for information about providing a \ncoordinated whole school and college approach to safeguarding.\nOngoing vigilance for all staff\n346. Governing bodies and proprietors should ensure they have processes in \nplace for continuous vigilance, maintaining an environment that deters and \nprevents abuse and challenges inappropriate behaviour.\n347. To support this, it is important that school and college leaders create the \nright culture and environment so that staff feel comfortable to discuss matters both \nwithin, and where it is appropriate, outside of the workplace (including online), \nwhich may have implications for the safeguarding of children. As set out in Part \none, Part two and Part four of this guidance it is important that all staff understand \nthe process and procedures to follow if they have a safeguarding concern about \nanother staff member. This can assist employers to support staff, where there is a \nneed, and help them manage children’s safety and welfare, potentially providing \nthem with information that will help them consider whether there are further \nmeasures or changes to procedures that need to be put in place to safeguard \nchildren in their care.\nExisting staff\n348. There are limited circumstances where schools and colleges will need to \ncarry out new checks on existing staff. These are when:\n• an individual working at the school or college moves from a post that was not \nregulated activity with children into work which is considered to be regulated\n",

Concerns / allegations that do not meet the harm threshold – referred to for \nthe purposes of this guidance as ‘low-level concerns’.\n358. These procedures should be consistent with local safeguarding procedures \nand practice guidance. \nSection one: Concerns or allegations that may meet the harm \nthreshold \n359. This part of the guidance is about managing cases of concerns/allegations \nthat might indicate a person would pose a risk of harm128 if they continue to work in \ntheir present position, or in any capacity with children in a school or college. In this \npart (section one) of the guidance reference is made to ‘allegation’ for ease. This \npart of the guidance should be followed where it is alleged that anyone working in \nthe school or a college that provides education for persons under 18 years of age, \nincluding supply teachers, volunteers and contractors has:\n• behaved in a way that has harmed a child, or may have harmed a child\nand/or\n• possibly committed a criminal offence against or related to a child, \nand/or\n• behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates he or she \nmay pose a risk of harm to children, and/or\n128 The harm test is explained in the Disclosure and Barring service Guidance: Making barring referrals to \nthe DBS and Section 31(9) of the Children Act 1989 as amended by the Adoption and Children Act 2002\n",

Before contacting \nthe LADO, schools and colleges should conduct basic enquiries in line with local \nprocedures to establish the facts and to help them determine whether there is any \nfoundation to the allegation, being careful not to jeopardise any future police \ninvestigation.

Where further enquiries are required to enable a decision about how to \nproceed, the LADO and case manager should discuss how and by whom the \ninvestigation will be undertaken. The LADO will provide advice and guidance to \nschools and colleges when considering allegations against adults working with \nchildren. The role of the LADO is not to investigate the allegation, but to ensure that \nan appropriate investigation is carried out, whether that is by the police, local \nauthority children’s social care, the school or college, or a combination of these. In \nstraightforward cases, the investigation should normally be undertaken by a senior \nmember of the school or college’s staff.\n374. Where there is a lack of appropriate resource within the school or college, or \nthe nature or complexity of the allegation requires it, the allegation will require an \nindependent investigator. Many local authorities provide for an independent \ninvestigation of allegations for schools that are maintained by the local authority, \noften as part of the HR/personnel services that schools and colleges can buy in \nfrom the authority. It is important that local authorities ensure that schools and\ncolleges in that area have access to an affordable facility for independent \ninvestigation where that is appropriate. Colleges, academies and independent \nschools should also ensure they secure the services of a person who is \nindependent of the school or college. \n375. The case manager should monitor the progress of cases to ensure that they \nare dealt with as quickly as possible in a thorough and fair process. Wherever \npossible, the first review should take place no later than four weeks after the initial \nassessment. \n376.

Governing bodies and proprietors should discuss with the supply \nagency or agencies where the supply teacher is working across a number of \nschools of colleges, whether it is appropriate to suspend the supply teacher, or \nredeploy them to another part of the school or college, whilst they carry out their \ninvestigation.\n379. Agencies should be fully involved and co-operate with any enquiries from the \nLADO, police and/or local authority children’s social care.

The welfare of a child is paramount (how children should be protected and \nsupported is set out throughout this guidance) and this will be the prime concern in \nterms of investigating an allegation against a person in a position of trust. However, \nwhen an allegation or safeguarding concern is being investigated it is likely to be a \nvery stressful experience for the adult subject to the investigation, and potentially \nfor their family members. It is important that an employer offers appropriate welfare \nsupport at such a time and recognises the sensitivity of the situation. Information is \nconfidential and should not ordinarily be shared with other staff or with children or \nparents who are not directly involved in the investigation.\n392. Employers have a duty of care to their employees. They should:\n• manage and minimise the stress caused by the allegation\n• inform the individual as soon as possible, explaining the likely course of \naction, guided by the LADO, and the police where necessary\n• advise the individual to contact their trade union representative, or a colleague \nfor support\n• appoint a named representative to keep the person informed about the \nprogress of the case\n• provide access to counselling or medical advice where appropriate. For staff in \nschools maintained by the local authority this may include support via the local \nauthority’s occupational health arrangements, and\n• not prevent social contact with work colleagues and friends, when staff are \nsuspended, unless there is evidence to suggest this may prejudice the \ngathering of evidence.\n393. Parents or carers of the child or children involved should be:\n• formally told about the allegation as soon as possible.130 The case manager \nshould consult the LADO and where involved, local authority children’s social \ncare and/or the police on what information can be disclosed\n130 In deciding what information is disclosed, careful consideration should be given to the provisions of the \nData Protection Act 2018, the law of confidence and, where relevant, the Human Rights Act 1998.\n",

Where the police are involved, wherever possible the school or college \nshould ask the police to obtain consent from the individuals involved to share their \nstatements and evidence for use in the employer’s disciplinary process. This should \nbe done as their investigation proceeds and will enable the police to share relevant \ninformation without delaying the conclusion of their investigation or any court case.\n396. Local authority children’s social care should adopt a similar procedure when \nmaking enquiries to determine whether the child or children named in the allegation \nare in need of protection or services, so that any information obtained in the course \nof those enquiries which is relevant to a disciplinary case can be passed to the \nemployer without delay.\n397. The school and college must make every effort to maintain confidentiality \nand guard against unwanted publicity while an allegation is being investigated or \nconsidered. The Education Act 2011 amended the Education Act 2002, to introduce \nreporting restrictions.

The reporting restrictions are disapplied if the individual to whom the \nrestrictions apply effectively waives their right to anonymity by going public \nthemselves or by giving their written consent for another to do so or if a court lifts \nthe reporting restrictions in response to a request to do so.\n400. The legislation prevents the “publication” of material by any person that may \nlead to the identification of the teacher who is the subject of the allegation. \n“Publication” includes “any speech, writing, relevant programme or other \ncommunication in whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large or any \nsection of the public.” This means that a parent who, for example, published details \nof the allegation on a social networking site would be in breach of the reporting \nrestrictions (if what was published could lead to the identification of the teacher by \nmembers of the public). In circumstances where schools need to make parents \naware about an allegation, they should make parents and others aware that there \nare restrictions on publishing information.\n401. In accordance with the Authorised Professional Practice published by the \nCollege of Policing in May 2017, the police will not normally provide any information \nto the press or media that might identify an individual who is under investigation, \nunless and until the person is charged with a criminal offence. In exceptional cases \nwhere the police wish to depart from that rule, for example an appeal to trace a \nsuspect, they must apply to a magistrates’ court to request that reporting \nrestrictions be lifted.\n402. The case manager should take advice from the LADO, the police and local \nauthority children’s social care to agree the following:\n• who needs to know and exactly what information can be shared\n• how to manage speculation, leaks and gossip\n• what, if any, information can be reasonably given to the wider community to \nreduce speculation and\n• how to manage press interest if, and when, it should arise.\nAllegation outcomes\n403.

Creating a culture in which all concerns about adults are shared responsibly \nand with the right person, recorded and dealt with appropriately, is critical.

The term ‘low-level’ concern does not mean that it is insignificant. A low-level \nconcern is any concern – no matter how small, and even if no more than causing a \nsense of unease or a ‘nagging doubt’ - that an adult working in or on behalf of the \nschool or college may have acted in a way that:\n• is inconsistent with the staff code of conduct, including inappropriate conduct \noutside of work, and\n• does not meet the harm threshold or is otherwise not serious enough to \nconsider a referral to the LADO. \nExamples of such behaviour could include, but are not limited to: \n• being over friendly with children\n• having favourites\n• taking photographs of children on their mobile phone, contrary to school policy\n• engaging with a child on a one-to-one basis in a secluded area or behind a \nclosed door, or\n• humiliating children. \n431. Such behaviour can exist on a wide spectrum, from the inadvertent or \nthoughtless, or behaviour that may look to be inappropriate, but might not be in \nspecific circumstances, through to that which is ultimately intended to enable \nabuse.\n432. Low-level concerns may arise in several ways and from a number of \nsources. For example: suspicion; complaint; or disclosure made by a child, parent\n",

It is for schools and colleges to decide how long they retain such information, \nbut it is recommended that it is retained at least until the individual leaves their \nemployment.\nReferences\n445. Part three of this guidance is clear that schools and colleges should only \nprovide substantiated safeguarding concerns/allegations (including a group of low\u0002level concerns about the same individual) that meet the harm threshold in \nreferences. Low-level concerns should not be included in references unless they \nrelate to issues which would normally be included in a reference, for example, \nmisconduct or poor performance. It follows that a low-level concern which relates \nexclusively to safeguarding (and not to misconduct or poor performance) should not \nbe referred to in a reference. \nResponding to low-level concerns\n446. The school or college low-level concerns policy should set out the procedure \nfor responding to reports of low-level concerns. If the concern has been raised via a \nthird party, the headteacher/principal (or a nominated deputy) should collect as \nmuch evidence as possible by speaking:\n• directly to the person who raised the concern, unless it has been raised \nanonymously, and\n• to the individual involved and any witnesses.\n447. The information collected will help them to categorise the type of behaviour \nand determine what further action may need to be taken. This information needs to \nbe recorded in writing along with the rationale for their decisions and action taken. \n448. A good low-level concerns policy will simply be a reflection and extension of \nthe school or college’s wider staff behaviour policy/code of conduct.\n449. More detailed guidance and case studies on low-level concerns can be \nfound in: Developing and implementing a low-level concerns policy: a guide for \norganisations which work with children (farrer.co.uk).\n",

This part of the statutory guidance is about how schools and colleges \nshould respond to all signs, reports and concerns of child-on-child sexual \nviolence and sexual harassment, including those that have happened outside of the \nschool or college premises, and/or online (what to look out for and indicators of \nabuse are set out in Part one of this guidance). As set out in Part one of this \nguidance, all staff working with children are advised to maintain an attitude of ‘it \ncould happen here’, and this is especially important when considering child-on\u0002child abuse.\nWhat schools and colleges should be aware of\n451. Sexual violence and sexual harassment can occur between two or more \nchildren of any age and sex, from primary through to secondary stage and into \ncollege. It can occur also through a group of children sexually assaulting or sexually \nharassing a single child or group of children. Sexual violence and sexual \nharassment exist on a continuum and may overlap; they can occur online and face\u0002to-face (both physically and verbally) and are never acceptable. Schools and \ncolleges should be aware of the importance of:\n• making clear that there is a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and \nsexual harassment, that it is never acceptable, and it will not be tolerated. It \nshould never be passed off as “banter”, “just having a laugh”, “a part of \ngrowing up” or “boys being boys”. Failure to do so can lead to a culture of \nunacceptable behaviour, an unsafe environment and in worst case scenarios \na culture that normalises abuse, leading to children accepting it as normal and \nnot coming forward to report it\n• recognising, acknowledging, and understanding the scale of harassment and \nabuse and that even if there are no reports it does not mean it is not \nhappening, it may be the case that it is just not being reported\n• challenging physical behaviour (potentially criminal in nature) such as \ngrabbing bottoms, breasts and genitalia, pulling down trousers, flicking bras \nand lifting up skirts. Dismissing or tolerating such behaviours risks normalising \nthem. \n452. Children who are victims of sexual violence and sexual harassment \nwherever it happens, may find the experience stressful and distressing. This will, in \nall likelihood, adversely affect their educational attainment and will be exacerbated \nif the alleged perpetrator(s) attends the same school or college.\n",

Whilst any report of sexual violence or sexual harassment should be taken \nseriously, staff should be aware it is more likely girls will be the victims of sexual \nviolence and sexual harassment and more likely it will be perpetrated by boys. \nChildren with disabilities are also three times more likely to be abused than their \npeers.\n135\n454. Ultimately, it is essential that all victims are reassured that they are being \ntaken seriously and that they will be supported and kept safe.\nSexual violence\n455. It is important that schools and colleges are aware of sexual violence and \nthe fact children can, and sometimes do, abuse other children in this way and that it \ncan happen both inside and outside of school/college. When referring to sexual \nviolence in this advice, we do so in the context of child-on-child sexual violence. \nWhen referring to sexual violence we are referring to sexual offences under the Sexual \nOffences Act 2003136 as described below:\nRape: A person (A) commits an offence of rape if: he intentionally penetrates the \nvagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis, B does not consent to the \npenetration and A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\nAssault by penetration: A person (A) commits an offence if: s/he intentionally \npenetrates the vagina or anus of another person (B) with a part of her/his body or \nanything else, the penetration is sexual, B does not consent to the penetration and A \ndoes not reasonably believe that B consents.\nSexual assault: A person (A) commits an offence of sexual assault if: s/he \nintentionally touches another person (B), the touching is sexual, B does not consent to \nthe touching and A does not reasonably believe that B consents. (NOTE - Schools and \ncolleges should be aware that sexual assault covers a very wide range of behaviour so \na single act of kissing someone without consent or touching someone’s \nbottom/breasts/genitalia without consent, can still constitute sexual assault). \nCausing someone to engage in sexual activity without consent: A person (A) \ncommits an offence if: s/he intentionally causes another person (B) to engage in an \nactivity, the activity is sexual, B does not consent to engaging in the activity, and A \ndoes not reasonably believe that B consents.

Consent can be withdrawn at any time during sexual activity and each time \nactivity occurs. Someone consents to vaginal, anal or oral penetration only if s/he \nagrees by choice to that penetration and has the freedom and capacity to make that \nchoice.138 \n• a child under the age of 13 can never consent to any sexual activity\n• the age of consent is 16 139\n• sexual intercourse without consent is rape\nFurther information about consent can be found here: Rape Crisis England & Wales - \nSexual consent\nSexual harassment\n456. When referring to sexual harassment we mean ‘unwanted conduct of a \nsexual nature’ that can occur online and offline and both inside and outside of \nschool or college. When we reference sexual harassment, we do so in the context \nof child-on-child sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is likely to: violate a child’s \ndignity, and/or make them feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated and/or create a \nhostile, offensive or sexualised environment.\n457. Whilst not intended to be an exhaustive list, sexual harassment can include:\n• sexual comments, such as telling sexual stories, making lewd comments, \nmaking sexual remarks about clothes and appearance and calling someone \nsexualised names\n• sexual “jokes” or taunting\n137 It is important school and college staff (and especially designated safeguarding leads and their \ndeputies) understand consent. This will be especially important if a child is reporting they have been raped\nor sexually assaulted in any way. Further information can be found at Rape Crisis\n138 PSHE Teaching about consent from the PSHE association provides advice and lesson plans to teach \nconsent at Key stage 3 and 4.\n139 It is important to differentiate between consensual sexual activity between children of a similar age and \nthat which involves any power imbalance, coercion or exploitation. Due to their additional training, the \ndesignated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) should be involved and generally speaking leading the school \nor college response. If in any doubt, they should seek expert advice.\n",

Sexual harassment (as set out above) creates a culture that, if not \nchallenged, can normalise inappropriate behaviours and provide an environment \nthat may lead to sexual violence.\nHarmful sexual behaviour\n459. Children’s sexual behaviour exists on a wide continuum, ranging from \nnormal and developmentally expected to inappropriate, problematic, abusive and \nviolent. Problematic, abusive and violent sexual behaviour is developmentally \ninappropriate and may cause developmental damage. A useful umbrella term is \n140 The Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019 which amends the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to make upskirting a \nspecific offence of voyeurism. The Act came into force on 12 April 2019.\n141Project deSHAME from Childnet provides useful research, advice and resources regarding online sexual \nharassment.\n142 Consensual image sharing, especially between older children of the same age, may require a different \nresponse.

HSB can occur online and/or face-to-face \nand can also occur simultaneously between the two. HSB should be \nconsidered in a child protection context.\n460. When considering HSB, both ages and the stages of development of the \nchildren are critical factors. Sexual behaviour between children can be considered \nharmful if one of the children is much older, particularly if there is more than two \nyears’ difference or if one of the children is pre-pubescent and the other is not. \nHowever, a younger child can abuse an older child, particularly if they have power \nover them, for example, if the older child is disabled or smaller in stature. \nConfidential specialist support and advice on HSB is available from the specialist \nsexual violence sector and sources are listed in Annex B. \n461. It is effective safeguarding practice for the designated safeguarding lead \n(and their deputies) to have a good understanding of HSB. This could form part of \ntheir safeguarding training. This will aid in planning preventative education, \nimplementing preventative measures, drafting and implementing an effective child \nprotection policy and incorporating the approach to sexual violence and sexual \nharassment into the whole school or college approach to safeguarding.\n462. HSB can, in some cases, progress on a continuum.143 Addressing \ninappropriate behaviour can be an important intervention that helps prevent \nproblematic, abusive and/or violent behaviour in the future. Children displaying \nHSB have often experienced their own abuse and trauma.144 It is important that \nthey are offered appropriate support.\nPreventing abuse\n463. Effective safeguarding practice is demonstrated when schools and colleges \nare clear, in advance, about what local processes are in place and what support \ncan be accessed when sexual violence or sexual harassment has occurred. It is \nimportant to prepare for this in advance and review this information on a regular \nbasis to ensure it is up to date. As such:\n• if required, the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) should discuss the \nlocal response to sexual violence and sexual harassment with police and local \nauthority children’s social care colleagues in order to prepare the schools or \n143 HSB framework and audit | NSPCC Learning discusses the continuum harmful behaviour can progress \non (Hackett 2019 continuum model).\n144 Hackett et al 2013 study of children and young people with harmful sexual behaviour suggests that two\u0002thirds had experienced some kind of abuse or trauma.\n",

The victim may ask the school or college not to tell anyone about the sexual \nviolence or sexual harassment. There are no easy or definitive answers when a \nvictim makes this request. If the victim does not give consent to share information, \nstaff may still lawfully share it, if there is another legal basis under the UK GDPR \nthat applies. For example, the public task basis may apply, where the overall \npurpose is to perform a public interest task or exercise official authority, and the \ntask or authority has a clear basis in law. Advice should be sought from the\ndesignated safeguarding lead (or a deputy), who should consider the following:\n• parents or carers should normally be informed (unless this would put the victim at \ngreater risk)\n• the basic safeguarding principle is: if a child is at risk of harm, is in immediate \ndanger, or has been harmed, a referral should be made to local authority \nchildren’s social care, and\n• rape, assault by penetration and sexual assaults are crimes. Where a report of \nrape, assault by penetration or sexual assault is made, this should be referred to \nthe police. Whilst the age of criminal responsibility is ten, if the alleged perpetrator \nis under ten, the starting principle of referring to the police remains. The police will \ntake a welfare, rather than a criminal justice approach, in these cases.\n478. Ultimately, the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) will have to \nbalance the victim’s wishes against their duty to protect the victim and other \nchildren.\n",

It is essential that all victims are reassured that they are being taken seriously \nand that they will be supported and kept safe. A victim should never be given the \nimpression that they are creating a problem by reporting sexual violence or sexual \nharassment. Nor should a victim ever be made to feel ashamed for making a report. \nReports of rape and assault by penetration are likely to be especially difficult for the \nvictim, and close proximity to the alleged perpetrator(s) is likely to be especially \ndistressing. Whilst the school or college establishes the facts of the case and starts the \nprocess of liaising with local authority children’s social care and the police, the alleged \nperpetrator(s) should be removed from any classes they share with the victim. The \nschool or college should also carefully consider how best to keep the victim and \nalleged perpetrator(s) a reasonable distance apart on school or college premises \n(including during any before or after school-based activities) and on transport to and \nfrom the school or college, where appropriate. These actions are in the best interests \nof all children involved and should not be perceived to be a judgement on the guilt of \nthe alleged perpetrator(s).\nFor other reports of sexual violence and sexual harassment, the proximity of the victim \nand alleged perpetrator(s) and considerations regarding shared classes, sharing \nschool or college premises and school or college transport, should be considered \nimmediately.\nIn all cases, the initial report should be carefully evaluated, reflecting the \nconsiderations set out at paragraphs 487-488. The wishes of the victim, the nature of \nthe allegations and the protection of all children in the school or college will be \nespecially important when considering any immediate actions.\nOptions to manage the report\n489. It is important that schools and colleges consider every report on a case-by\u0002case basis as per paragraph 487. When to inform the alleged perpetrator(s) will be \na decision that should be carefully considered. Where a report is going to be made \nto local authority children’s social care and/or the police, then, as a general rule, the \ndesignated safeguarding lead should speak to the local authority children’s social \ncare and the police and discuss next steps and how the alleged perpetrator(s) will \nbe informed of the allegations.

There are four likely scenarios for schools and colleges to consider when \nmanaging any reports of sexual violence and/or sexual harassment. The four \nscenarios are:\n1. Manage internally\n491. In some cases of sexual harassment, for example, one-off incidents, the \nschool or college may take the view that the children concerned are not in need of \nearly help or that referrals to statutory services are not required, and that it would \nbe appropriate to handle the incident internally, perhaps through utilising their \nbehaviour policy and by providing pastoral support.\n492. Whatever the response, it should be underpinned by the principle that there \nis a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and sexual harassment, and it is \nnever acceptable and will not be tolerated.\n493. All concerns, discussions, decisions and reasons for decisions should be \nrecorded (written or electronic).\nCase study\nA 12-year-old girl reported to the head of year that five boys in her friendship group \nwere playing a game, which involved daring each other to use increasingly graphic \nsexually explicit language, describing what they would like to do to her. She was very \nupset but did not want to get anyone into trouble or everyone to know about it. She just \nwanted them to stop. She explained this to her head of year. The head of year \nexplained to her that what she had experienced was extremely serious and reassured \nher that her reaction was completely understandable. He also explained that he would \npass the report to the designated safeguarding lead to ensure records were updated. \nHe explained he would be following the school’s behaviour policy and would speak to \nthe boys involved and their parents, making it clear that what they were doing was \nsexual bullying and harassment and taken extremely seriously. The girl’s parents were \ncontacted and given the opportunity to discuss the action the school planned to take.\nResult: the boys were removed from the classroom and reprimanded with their parents \npresent. It was made clear that the behaviour was unacceptable, and they received a \npunishment in line with the school’s behaviour policy. They were also warned about the \nmore severe consequences that would arise if the harassment continued.\n",

In line with managing internally, the school or college may decide that the \nchildren involved do not require referral to statutory services but may benefit from \nearly help. Early help is support for children of all ages that improves a family’s \nresilience and outcomes or reduces the chance of a problem getting worse. \nProviding early help is more effective in promoting the welfare of children than \nreacting later. Early help can be particularly useful to address non-violent HSB and \nmay prevent escalation of sexual violence. It is particularly important that the \ndesignated safeguarding lead (and their deputies) know what the local early help \nprocess is and how and where to access support.\n495. More information on early help is set out in Part one of this guidance with full \ndetails of the early help process in Working Together to Safeguard Children. \n496. Multi-agency early help will work best when placed alongside strong school \nor college policies, preventative education and engagement with parents and \ncarers.\n497. Schools and colleges, as relevant agencies, should be part of discussions \nwith statutory safeguarding partners to agree the levels for the different types of \nassessment and services to be commissioned and delivered, as part of the local \narrangements. Safeguarding partners should publish a local threshold document \nwhich includes the process for the local early help assessment and the type and \nlevel of early help services to be provided, and designated safeguarding leads (and \ntheir deputies) will need to familiarise themselves with this document. \n498. Early help and the option to manage a report internally do not need to be \nmutually exclusive: a school could manage internally and seek early help for both \nthe victim and alleged perpetrator(s).\n499. Whatever the response, it should be under-pinned by the principle that there \nis zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and sexual harassment and that both \nare never acceptable and will not be tolerated.\n500. All concerns, discussions, decisions and reasons for decisions should be \nrecorded (written or electronic).\n3. Referrals to local authority children’s social care\n501.

Where a report of rape, assault by penetration or sexual assault is made, the \nstarting point is that this should be passed on to the police. Whilst the age of \ncriminal responsibility is ten, if the alleged perpetrator(s) is under ten, the starting \nprinciple of reporting to the police remains. The police will take a welfare, rather \nthan a criminal justice, approach. The following advice may help schools and \ncolleges decide when to engage the Police and what to expect of them when they \ndo: When to call the police. \n512. Where a report has been made to the police, the school or college should \nconsult the police and agree what information can be disclosed to staff and others, \nin particular, the alleged perpetrator(s) and their parents or carers. They should \nalso discuss the best way to protect the victim and their anonymity.\n513. At this stage, schools and colleges will generally inform parents or carers \nunless there are compelling reasons not to, for example, if informing a parent or \ncarer is likely to put a child at additional risk. In circumstances where parents or \ncarers have not been informed, it will be especially important that the school or \ncollege is supporting the child in any decision they take. This should be with the \nsupport of local authority children’s social care and any appropriate specialist \nagencies.\n514. All police forces in England have specialist units that investigate child abuse. \nThe names and structures of these units are matters for local forces. It will be \nimportant that the designated safeguarding lead (and their deputies) are aware of \ntheir local arrangements.\n515. In some cases, it may become clear very quickly that the police (for \nwhatever reason) will not take further action. In such circumstances, it is important \nthat the school or college continues to engage with specialist support for the victim \nand alleged perpetrator(s) as required.\n516. Whilst protecting children and/or taking any disciplinary measures against \nthe alleged perpetrator(s), it will be important for the designated safeguarding lead \n(or a deputy) to work closely with the police (and other agencies as required), to \nensure any actions the school or college take do not jeopardise the police \ninvestigation.\n517. If a school or college has questions about the investigation, they should ask \nthe police. The police will help and support the school or college as much as they \ncan (within the constraints of any legal restrictions).\n",

If a child is convicted or receives a caution for a sexual offence, the school or \ncollege should update its risk assessment, ensure relevant protections are in place \nfor all the children at the school or college and, if it has not already, consider any \nsuitable action in line with their behaviour policy.

The school made a referral \nto local authority children’s social care on the same day, submitting a MARF (Multi \nAgency Referral Form) for both children. The MARF led to immediate police \ninvolvement. The school arranged for the boy to have an amended timetable so that he \nwas not in any class with the girl. Specific teaching staff were briefed on the need to \nensure the children were not together. The girl was given a trusted adult she could go \nto at any time. This staff member agreed she would meet with the girl every day and \nshe supported her with break and lunchtime arrangements. The girl was able to \nsuggest how she would feel safest at lunchtime.\nAt the end of the second day, another girl went to the designated safeguarding lead \n(DSL) and made a report about the same boy. She reported that he had sexually \nassaulted her in school three weeks before. The school submitted a MARF for the girl \nand a second MARF for the boy. The school knew the police were involved and that a \nMERLIN (a crime report involving a child) had been submitted, but they knew the police \nwould not have the ongoing and detailed information held by the school about the boy. \nThe school did not want either girl further distressed by possibly seeing the boy around \nschool. The option choices and group sizes for the three children meant it was very \ndifficult to educate separately. The school contacted another secondary school. The \nschool links had been established as part of the In Year Fair Access Process (IYFAP) \nand made immediate arrangements for the boy to move to the other school so that his \neducation was not disrupted. The boy remained at the new school for the duration of \nthe investigation. The DSLs from both schools worked together with police and the \nchildren and ensured appropriate child protection information was shared so the \nreceiving school was fully aware of the allegations. The boy received a caution, and the \ndecision was made for him to remain at his new school where he engaged with a \npersonalised RSHE plan. Parents were involved throughout. The children were at the \ncentre of decision-making, often suggesting how they could be supported.\nUnsubstantiated, unfounded, false or malicious reports\n532. As set out in paragraph 66 of Part one of this guidance, all concerns, \ndiscussions and decisions made, and the reasons for those decisions, should be \nrecorded in writing. Records should be reviewed so that potential patterns of \nconcerning, problematic or inappropriate behaviour can be identified, and \naddressed.\n",

If a report is determined to be unsubstantiated, unfounded, false or \nmalicious, the designated safeguarding lead should consider whether the child \nand/or the person who has made the allegation is in need of help or may have been \nabused by someone else and this was a cry for help. In such circumstances, a \nreferral to local authority children’s social care may be appropriate.\n534. If a report is shown to be deliberately invented or malicious, the school or \ncollege, should consider whether any disciplinary action is appropriate against the \nindividual who made it as per their own behaviour policy. \nOngoing response\nSafeguarding and supporting the victim\n535. The following principles are based on effective safeguarding practice and \nshould help shape any decisions regarding safeguarding and supporting the victim.\n• The needs and wishes of the victim should be paramount (along with protecting \nthe child) in any response. It is important they feel in as much control of the \nprocess as is reasonably possible. Wherever possible, the victim, if they wish, \nshould be able to continue in their normal routine. Overall, the priority should be to \nmake the victim’s daily experience as normal as possible, so that the school or \ncollege is a safe space for them. \n• Consider the age and the developmental stage of the victim, the nature of the \nallegation(s) and the potential risk of further abuse. Schools and colleges should \nbe aware that, by the very nature of sexual violence and sexual harassment, a \npower imbalance is likely to have been created between the victim and alleged \nperpetrator(s). \n• The victim should never be made to feel they are the problem for making a report \nor made to feel ashamed for making a report. \n• Consider the proportionality of the response. Support should be tailored on a \ncase-by-case basis. The support required regarding a one-off incident of \nsexualised name-calling is likely to be vastly different from that for a report of rape. \n• Schools and colleges should be aware that sexual assault can result in a range of \nhealth needs, including physical, mental, and sexual health problems and \nunwanted pregnancy. Children and young people that have a health need arising \nfrom sexual assault or abuse can access specialist NHS support from a Sexual \nAssault Referral Centre (SARC). SARCs offer confidential and non-judgemental \nsupport to victims and survivors of sexual assault and abuse. They provide \nmedical, practical, and emotional care and advice to all children and adults,\n",

The video was then uploaded to a \nsite and shared around their school and other schools in the area.\nFollowing this, the girl was sexually harassed at school being called a ‘slag and a slut’ \nduring lessons. Other boys in the school began propositioning her in school and trying \nto touch her aggressively and inappropriately. A teacher who saw the sexual \nharassment in his class talked to the girl about how she was feeling and suggested she \nspoke to the designated safeguarding lead (DSL). The DSL spoke to the girl and \nrecorded the report, discussed her options about trying to get the video deleted from \npeople’s devices and the website it was on, and how to talk to her parents about what \nhappened. The teachers and parents did not view the video, and this was \ncommunicated to the girl and boy.\nWhilst in this case the boy was not harassed in the same way as the girl, the school \nrecognised he was also a victim and spoke to him about his feelings and what could be \ndone to support him.\nThe teacher arranged a workshop as part of the RSHE curriculum for all Year 10s \nabout respect, shame, consent, and their collective responsibility to challenge \ninappropriate sexual behaviour.\nThe parents of the girl and boy worked with the school and the police to get the content \nremoved via the IWF and identify who recorded and distributed the video. Both the girl \nand boy were supported through the investigation with counselling.\nThose responsible for harassing the girl and sharing the video received sanctions in \nline with the school behaviour policy.\n537. Victims may not disclose the whole picture immediately. They may be more \ncomfortable providing information on a piecemeal basis. It is essential that dialogue \nis kept open and encouraged. When it is clear that ongoing support will be required, \nschools and colleges should ask the victim if they would find it helpful to have a \ndesignated trusted adult (for example, their form tutor or designated safeguarding \nlead) to talk to about their needs. The choice of any such adult should be the \nvictim’s (as far as is reasonably possible). Schools and colleges should respect and \nsupport this choice.\n538. Children who have experienced sexual violence display a very wide range of \nresponses to their experience, including in some cases clear signs of trauma,\n",

Schools and colleges \nshould remain alert to the possible challenges of detecting those signs and show \nsensitivity to the needs of the child (e.g. about attendance in lessons) irrespective \nof how overt the child’s distress is.\n539. While schools and colleges should avoid any action that would have the \neffect of isolating the victim, in particular from supportive peer groups, there may be \ntimes when the victim finds it difficult to maintain a full-time timetable and may \nexpress a wish to withdraw from lessons and activities. This should be because the \nvictim wants to, not because it makes it easier to manage the situation. If required, \nschools and colleges should provide a physical space for victims to withdraw to. \n540.

Whilst they should be given all the necessary support to remain in their \nschool or college, if the trauma results in the victim being unable to do this, \nalternative provision or a move to another school or college should be considered \nto enable them to continue to receive suitable education.

It is important that if the victim does move to another educational institution \n(for any reason), that the new educational institution is made aware of any ongoing \nsupport needs. The designated safeguarding lead should take responsibility to \nensure this happens (and should discuss with the victim and, where appropriate \ntheir parents or carers as to the most suitable way of doing this) as well as \ntransferring the child protection file.

Once the designated \nsafeguarding lead (or a deputy) has decided what the next steps will be in terms of \nprogressing the report, they should carefully consider again the question of the victim \nand alleged perpetrator(s) sharing classes and sharing space at school or college. This \nwill inevitably involve complex and difficult professional decisions, including considering \ntheir duty to safeguard children and their duty to educate them.\nIt is important each report is considered on a case-by-case basis and risk assessments \nare updated as appropriate. As always when concerned about the welfare of a child, \nthe best interests of the child should come first. In all cases, schools and colleges \nshould follow general safeguarding principles as per this guidance.\nWhere there is a criminal investigation into a rape, assault by penetration or sexual \nassault, the alleged perpetrator(s) should be removed from any classes they share with \nthe victim. The school or college should also consider how best to keep the victim and \nalleged perpetrator(s) a reasonable distance apart on school or college premises \n(including during before and after school-based activities) and on transport to and from \nschool or college where appropriate. This is in the best interests of both children and \nshould not be perceived to be a judgement on the guilt of the alleged perpetrator(s). As \nper paragraph 508, close liaison with the police is essential.\nWhere a criminal investigation into a rape or assault by penetration leads to a \nconviction or caution, the school or college should take suitable action, if they have not \nalready done so. In all but the most exceptional of circumstances, the rape or assault is \nlikely to constitute a serious breach of discipline and lead to the view that allowing the \nperpetrator(s) to remain in the same school or college would seriously harm the \neducation or welfare of the victim (and potentially other pupils or students).\nWhere a criminal investigation into sexual assault leads to a conviction or caution, the \nschool or college should, if it has not already, consider any suitable sanctions in light of \ntheir behaviour policy, including consideration of permanent exclusion.146 Where the \nperpetrator(s) is going to remain at the school or college, the principle would be to \ncontinue keeping the victim and perpetrator(s) in separate classes and continue to \nconsider the most appropriate way to manage potential contact on school and college \npremises and transport. The nature of the conviction or caution and wishes of the \nvictim will be especially important in determining how to proceed in such cases.\nIn all cases, schools and colleges should record and be able to justify their decision\u0002making.\n",

In some cases, rape, assault by \npenetration, sexual assault or sexual harassment are reported to the police and the \ncase is not progressed or are reported to the police and ultimately result in a not guilty \nverdict. None of this means the offence did not happen or that the victim lied. The \nprocess will have affected both victim and alleged perpetrator(s). Appropriate support \nshould be provided to both as required and consideration given to sharing classes and \npotential contact as required on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, schools and \ncolleges should record and be able to justify their decision-making.\nAll of the above should be considered with the needs and wishes of the victim at the \nheart of the process (supported by parents and carers as required). Any arrangements \nshould be kept under review.\nSafeguarding and supporting the alleged perpetrator(s) and children and young \npeople who have displayed harmful sexual behaviour\n545. The following principles are based on effective safeguarding practice and should \nhelp shape any decisions regarding safeguarding and supporting the alleged \nperpetrator(s):\n• The school or college will have a difficult balancing act to consider. On one hand, \nthey need to safeguard the victim (and the wider pupil/student body) and on the \nother hand provide the alleged perpetrator(s) with an education, safeguarding \nsupport as appropriate and implement any disciplinary sanctions. Taking \ndisciplinary action and still providing appropriate support are not mutually \nexclusive actions. They can, and should, occur at the same time if necessary.\n• Consider the age and the developmental stage of the alleged perpetrator(s), the \nnature of the allegations and frequency of allegations. Any child will likely \nexperience stress as a result of being the subject of allegations and/or negative \nreactions by their peers to the allegations against them.\n• Consider the proportionality of the response. Support (and sanctions) should be \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. The alleged perpetrator(s) may potentially \nhave unmet needs (in some cases these may be considerable) as well as \npotentially posing a risk of harm to other children. HSB in young children may be \n(and often is147) a symptom of either their own abuse or exposure to abusive \n146 Maintained schools, academies and pupil referral units should follow the statutory guidance here. \nIndependent schools and colleges should consider excluding as per their own policies.\n147 Hackett et al 2013 study of children and young people with harmful sexual behaviour suggests that two\u0002thirds had experienced some kind of abuse or trauma.\n",

Disciplinary action \ncan be taken whilst other investigations by the police and/or local authority \nchildren’s social care are ongoing. The fact that another body is investigating or has \ninvestigated an incident does not in itself prevent a school from coming to its own \nconclusion, on the balance of probabilities, about what happened, and imposing a \npenalty accordingly. This is a matter for the school and should be carefully \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. The designated safeguarding lead (or a \ndeputy) should take a leading role. The school should consider if, by taking any \naction, it would prejudice an investigation and/or any subsequent prosecution. \nCareful liaison with the police and/or local authority children’s social care should \nhelp the school make a determination. It will also be important to consider whether \nthere are circumstances that make it unreasonable or irrational for the school to \nreach its own view about what happened while an independent investigation is \nconsidering the same facts.\nColleges\n549. Whilst colleges are not under the same legal obligations as schools with \nregard to behaviour, the principles set out in paragraph 550 will still be relevant and \nshould be applied to their decision-making process.\nDiscipline and support\n550. Taking disciplinary action and still providing appropriate support are not \nmutually exclusive actions. They can, and should, occur at the same time if \nnecessary. The school or college should be very clear as to what its approach is. \nOn the one hand there is preventative or forward-looking action to safeguard the \nvictim and/or the perpetrator(s), especially where there are concerns that a \nperpetrator themselves may have been a victim of abuse; and, on the other, there \nis disciplinary action to punish a perpetrator for their past conduct. The school or \ncollege should be very clear as to which category any action they are taking falls or \nwhether it is really both and should ensure that the action complies with the law \nrelating to each relevant category.\n",

The school or college will, in most instances, engage with both the victim’s \nand the parents or carers of the alleged perpetrator(s) when there has been a \nreport of sexual violence (this might not be necessary or proportionate in the case \nof sexual harassment and should be considered on a case-by-case basis). The \nexception to this rule is if there is a reason to believe informing a parent or carer will \nput a child at additional risk. Schools and colleges should carefully consider what \ninformation they provide to the respective parents or carers about the other child \ninvolved and when they do so. In some cases, local authority children’s social care \nand/or the police will have a very clear view and it will be important for the school or \ncollege to work with relevant agencies to ensure a consistent approach is taken to \ninformation sharing.\n552. It is good practice for the school or college to meet the victim’s parents or \ncarers with the victim present to discuss what arrangements are being put in place \nto safeguard the victim and understand their wishes in terms of support they may \nneed and how the report will be progressed. \n553. It is also good practice for the school or college to meet the parents or carers \nof the alleged perpetrator(s) to discuss any arrangements that are being put into \nplace that impact an alleged perpetrator(s), such as, for example, moving them out \nof classes with the victim and what this means for their education. The reason \nbehind any decisions should be explained. Support for the alleged perpetrator(s) \nshould be discussed.\n554. The designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) would generally attend any \nsuch meetings. Consideration to the attendance of other agencies should be \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis.\n555. Clear behaviour policies and child protection policies, especially policies that \nset out the principles of how reports of sexual violence will be managed and how \nvictims and alleged perpetrators are likely to be supported, that parents and carers \nhave access to, will, in some cases, help manage what are inevitably very difficult \nconversations.\n556. Parents and carers may well struggle to cope with a report that their child \nhas been the victim of a sexual assault or is alleged to have sexually assaulted \nanother child. Details of organisations that support parents are provided in Annex \nB. Schools and colleges should consider signposting parents and carers to this \nsupport.\n",

Consideration should be given to supporting children (and adult students) \nwho have witnessed sexual violence, especially rape and assault by penetration. \nWitnessing such an event is likely to be traumatic and support may be required.\n558. Following any report of sexual violence or sexual harassment, it is likely that \nsome children will take “sides”. The school or college should be doing all they can \nto ensure both the victim and alleged perpetrator(s), and any witnesses, are not \nbeing bullied or harassed.\n559. Social media is very likely to play a central role in the fall out from any \nincident or alleged incident. There is the potential for contact between victim and \nalleged perpetrator(s) and a very high likelihood that friends from either side could \nharass the victim or alleged perpetrator(s) online and/or become victims of \nharassment themselves. Specialist online safety support is discussed at paragraph\n469. \n560. School transport is a potentially vulnerable place for a victim or alleged \nperpetrator(s) following any incident or alleged incident. The school or college, as \npart of its risk assessment, should consider any additional potential support needs \nto keep all of their children safe.\n561. A whole school or college approach to safeguarding, a culture that makes \nclear that there is a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and sexual \nharassment and that both are never acceptable, and it will not be tolerated, and a \nstrong preventative education programme will help create an environment in which \nall children at the school or college are supportive and respectful of their peers \nwhen reports of sexual violence or sexual harassment are made.\n562. It is important that schools and colleges keep their policies, processes, and \ncurriculum under constant review to protect all their children. Reports of sexual \nviolence and sexual harassment (especially where there is evidence of patterns of \nbehaviour) may point to environmental and or systemic problems that could and \nshould be addressed by updating relevant policies, processes, or relevant parts of \nthe curriculum. Alongside this, patterns identified in schools may also be reflective \nof the wider issues within a local area and it is good practice to share emerging \ntrends with safeguarding partners.\n",

Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is everyone’s \nresponsibility. Everyone who comes into contact with children has an important role to \nplay.\n2. School and college staff are particularly important as they are in a position to \nidentify concerns early, provide help for children, promote children’s welfare and \nprevent concerns from escalating. It is important all staff (including those who do not \nwork directly with children) recognise the important role they play in protecting \nchildren.\nWhat school and college staff need to know\n3. For the purposes of safeguarding, a child is anyone under the age of 18. \nSafeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is defined for the purposes of this \nguidance as:\n• providing help and support to meet the needs of children as soon as problems \nemerge\n• protecting children from maltreatment, whether that is within or outside the home, \nincluding online\n• preventing impairment of children’s mental and physical health or development\n• ensuring that children grow up in circumstances consistent with the provision of \nsafe and effective care, and\n• taking action to enable all children to have the best outcomes \nAll staff should:\n• Be aware of the systems in their school or college which support safeguarding, \nand these should be explained to them as part of staff induction. As a minimum \nthis Annex and the child protection policy should be shared with staff at induction.\n",

Children may be abused by \nother children or adults, in a family or in an institutional or community setting by those \nknown to them or, more rarely, by others.\n7. Physical abuse: a form of abuse that may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, \npoisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating or otherwise causing physical \nharm to a child.\n8. Emotional abuse: the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child such as to \ncause severe and adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may involve \nconveying to a child that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only \ninsofar as they meet the needs of another person. Some level of emotional abuse is \ninvolved in all types of maltreatment of a child, although it may occur alone.\n9. Sexual abuse: involves forcing or enticing a child or young person to take part \nin sexual activities, not necessarily involving violence, whether or not the child is aware \nof what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, including assault by \npenetration (for example, rape or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as \nmasturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching outside of clothing. They may also include \nnon-contact activities, such as involving children in looking at, or in the production of, \nsexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually \ninappropriate ways, or grooming a child in preparation for abuse. Sexual abuse can \ntake place online, and technology can be used to facilitate offline abuse. Sexual abuse \nis not solely perpetrated by adult males. Females can also be abusers as can other \nchildren. The sexual abuse of children by other children is a specific safeguarding \nissue (also known as child-on-child abuse) in education and all staff should be aware \nof it and their school or colleges policy and procedures for dealing with it. \n10. Neglect: the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or \npsychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or \ndevelopment. Neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to provide adequate food, \nclothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment); protect a child \nfrom physical and emotional harm or danger; ensure adequate supervision (including \nthe use of inadequate caregivers); or ensure access to appropriate medical care or \ntreatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic \nemotional needs.\n11.

The designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) will generally lead on next \nsteps, including who else, if anyone, in the school or college should be informed and \nwhether to pass a concern to local authority children’s social care and/or the police. In \nsome instances, staff may be expected to support the local authority children social \ncare assessment process. If this is the case, the designated safeguarding lead (or a \ndeputy) will support them.\nWhy all of this is important\n19. It is important for children to receive the right help at the right time to address \nsafeguarding risks and prevent issues escalating and to promote children’s welfare. \nResearch and serious case reviews have repeatedly shown the dangers of failing to \ntake effective and immediate action. Examples of poor practice includes failing to act \non and refer the early signs of abuse and neglect.\nWhat school and college staff should do if they have a safeguarding concern or an \nallegation about another staff member who may pose a risk of harm to children\n20. If staff have a safeguarding concern or an allegation is made about another \nmember of staff (including supply staff, contractors, volunteers, and visitors) harming \nor posing a risk of harm to children, they should speak to the headteacher or principal \n(unless it relates to the headteacher or principal, in which case they should speak to \nthe chair of governors, chair of the management committee, or the proprietor of an \nindependent school). \nWhat school or college staff should do if they have concerns about safeguarding \npractices within the school or college\n21. All staff and volunteers should feel able to raise concerns about poor or unsafe \npractice and potential failures in the school or college’s safeguarding regime and know \nthat such concerns will be taken seriously by the senior leadership team.\n22. Appropriate whistleblowing procedures should be in place for concerns to be \nraised with the school or college’s senior leadership team.\n23. Where staff feel unable to raise an issue with the employer or feel that their \ngenuine safeguarding concerns are not being addressed NSPCC whistleblowing \nadvice line is available. Staff can call 0800 0280285 – 08:00 to 20:00, Monday to \nFriday and 09:00 to 18:00 at weekends. The email address is: help@nspcc.org.uk.\nAlternatively, staff can write to: National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to \nChildren (NSPCC), Weston House, 42 Curtain Road, London EC2A 3NH.\n",

Child abduction can be committed by \nparents or other family members; by people known but not related to the victim (such as \nneighbours, friends and acquaintances); and by strangers.\nOther community safety incidents in the vicinity of a school can raise concerns amongst \nchildren and parents, for example, people loitering nearby or unknown adults engaging \nchildren in conversation.\nAs children get older and are granted more independence (for example, as they start \nwalking to school on their own) it is important they are given practical advice on how to \nkeep themselves safe. Many schools provide outdoor-safety lessons run by teachers or \nby local police staff.\nIt is important that lessons focus on building children’s confidence and abilities rather \nthan simply warning them about all strangers. Further information is available at: \nwww.actionagainstabduction.org and www.clevernevergoes.org. \nChild criminal exploitation (CCE) and child sexual exploitation (CSE)\nWe know that different forms of harm often overlap, and that perpetrators may subject \nchildren and young people to multiple forms of abuse, such as criminal exploitation \n(including county lines) and sexual exploitation.\nIn some cases, the exploitation or abuse will be in exchange for something the victim \nneeds or wants (for example, money, gifts or affection), and/or will be to the financial \nbenefit or other advantage, such as increased status, of the perpetrator or facilitator.\nChildren can be exploited by adult males or females, as individuals or groups. They may \nalso be exploited by other children, who themselves may be experiencing exploitation – \nwhere this is the case, it is important that the child perpetrator is also recognised as a \nvictim.\nWhilst the age of the child may be a contributing factor for an imbalance of power, there \nare a range of other factors that could make a child more vulnerable to exploitation, \nincluding, sexual identity, cognitive ability, learning difficulties, communication ability, \nphysical strength, status, and access to economic or other resources.\nSome of the following can be indicators of both child criminal and sexual exploitation \nwhere children: \n• appear with unexplained gifts, money or new possessions\n",

There are diagrams illustrating the courtroom structure and the use of video \nlinks is explained.\nMaking child arrangements via the family courts following separation can be stressful and \nentrench conflict in families.

This may include abuse and neglect\nsuch as sexual abuse or exploitation and can also be a sign of child criminal exploitation \nincluding involvement in county lines. It may indicate mental health problems, risk of \nsubstance abuse, risk of travelling to conflict zones, risk of female genital mutilation, so\u0002called ‘honour’-based abuse or risk of forced marriage. Early intervention is essential to \nidentify the existence of any underlying safeguarding risk and to help prevent the risks of \na child going missing in future. It is important that staff are aware of their school or \ncollege’s unauthorised absence procedures and children missing education procedures.\nChildren with family members in prison\nApproximately 200,000 children in England and Wales have a parent sent to prison each \nyear. These children are at risk of poor outcomes including poverty, stigma, isolation and \npoor mental health. The National Information Centre on Children of Offenders, NICCO\nprovides information designed to support professionals working with offenders and their \nchildren, to help mitigate negative consequences for those children.\nCybercrime\nCybercrime is criminal activity committed using computers and/or the internet. It is \nbroadly categorised as either ‘cyber-enabled’ (crimes that can happen off-line but are \nenabled at scale and at speed on-line) or ‘cyber dependent’ (crimes that can be \ncommitted only by using a computer). Cyber-dependent crimes include: \n• unauthorised access to computers (illegal ‘hacking’), for example accessing a \nschool’s computer network to look for test paper answers or change grades \nawarded\n• ‘Denial of Service’ (Dos or DDoS) attacks or ‘booting’. These are attempts to make \na computer, network or website unavailable by overwhelming it with internet traffic \nfrom multiple sources, and,\n• making, supplying or obtaining malware (malicious software) such as viruses, \nspyware, ransomware, botnets and Remote Access Trojans with the intent to \ncommit further offence, including those above.\nChildren with particular skills and interest in computing and technology may inadvertently \nor deliberately stray into cyber-dependent crime.\nIf there are concerns about a child in this area, the designated safeguarding lead (or a \ndeputy), should consider referring into the Cyber Choices programme.

The Act \nintroduced the first ever statutory definition of domestic abuse and recognises the impact \nof domestic abuse on children, as victims in their own right, if they see, hear or \nexperience the effects of abuse. The statutory definition of domestic abuse, based on the \nprevious cross-government definition, ensures that different types of relationships are \ncaptured, including ex-partners and family members. The definition captures a range of \ndifferent abusive behaviours, including physical, emotional and economic abuse and \ncoercive and controlling behaviour. Under the statutory definition, both the person who is \ncarrying out the behaviour and the person to whom the behaviour is directed towards \nmust be aged 16 or over and they must be “personally connected” (as defined in section \n2 of the 2021 Act).\nTypes of domestic abuse include intimate partner violence, abuse by family members, \nteenage relationship abuse and child to parent abuse. Anyone can be a victim of \ndomestic abuse, regardless of sexual identity, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, \nsexuality or background and domestic abuse can take place inside or outside of the \nhome. The government has issued statutory guidance to provide further information for \nthose working with domestic abuse victims and perpetrators, including the impact on \nchildren.\nAll children can witness and be adversely affected by domestic abuse in the context of \ntheir home life where domestic abuse occurs between family members. Experiencing \ndomestic abuse can have a serious, long lasting emotional and psychological impact on \nchildren. In some cases, a child may blame themselves for the abuse or may have had to \nleave the family home as a result.\nYoung people can also experience domestic abuse within their own intimate \nrelationships. This form of child-on-child abuse is sometimes referred to as ‘teenage \nrelationship abuse’. Depending on the age of the young people, this may not be\n",

However, as with any child under 18, where there are concerns about \nsafety or welfare, child safeguarding procedures should be followed and both young \nvictims and young perpetrators should be offered support. \nOperation Encompass\nOperation Encompass operates in all police forces across England. It helps police and \nschools work together to provide emotional and practical help to children. The system \nensures that when the police are called to an incident of domestic abuse, where there are \nchildren in the household who have experienced the domestic incident, the police will \ninform the key adult (usually the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy)) in school \nbefore the child or children arrive at school the following day. This ensures that the \nschool has up to date relevant information about the child’s circumstances and can \nenable immediate support to be put in place, according to the child’s needs. Operation \nEncompass does not replace statutory safeguarding procedures. Where appropriate, the \npolice and/or schools should make a referral to local authority children’s social care if \nthey are concerned about a child’s welfare. More information about the scheme and how \nschools can become involved is available on the Operation Encompass website.\nOperation Encompass provides an advice and helpline service for all staff members from \neducational settings who may be concerned about children who have experienced \ndomestic abuse. The helpline is available 8:00 to 13:00, Monday to Friday on 0204 513 \n9990 (charged at local rate).\nNational Domestic Abuse Helpline\nRefuge runs the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, which can be called free of charge \nand in confidence, 24 hours a day on 0808 2000 247. Its website provides guidance and \nsupport for potential victims, as well as those who are worried about friends and loved \nones. It also has a form through which a safe time from the team for a call can be \nbooked.\nAdditional advice on identifying children who are affected by domestic abuse and how \nthey can be helped is available at:\n• NSPCC- UK domestic-abuse Signs Symptoms Effects\n• Refuge what is domestic violence/effects of domestic violence on children\n• Safe Young Lives: Young people and domestic abuse | Safelives\n• Domestic abuse: specialist sources of support (includes information for adult \nvictims, young people facing abuse in their own relationships and parents \nexperiencing child to parent violence/abuse)\n",

The designated safeguarding lead (and any deputies) should be aware of \ncontact details and referral routes into the Local Housing Authority so they can \nraise/progress concerns at the earliest opportunity. Indicators that a family may be at risk \nof homelessness include household debt, rent arrears, domestic abuse and anti-social \nbehaviour, as well as the family being asked to leave a property. Whilst referrals and/or \ndiscussion with the Local Housing Authority should be progressed as appropriate, and in \naccordance with local procedures, this does not, and should not, replace a referral into \nlocal authority children’s social care where a child has been harmed or is at risk of harm.\nThe Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 places a new legal duty on English councils so \nthat everyone who is homeless or at risk of homelessness will have access to meaningful \nhelp including an assessment of their needs and circumstances, the development of a \npersonalised housing plan, and work to help them retain their accommodation or find a \nnew place to live. The following factsheets usefully summarise the new duties: Homeless \nReduction Act Factsheets. The new duties shift the focus to early intervention and \nencourages those at risk to seek support as soon as possible, before they are facing a \nhomelessness crisis.\nIn most cases school and college staff will be considering homelessness in the context of \nchildren who live with their families, and intervention will be on that basis. However, it \nshould also be recognised in some cases 16- and 17-year-olds could be living \nindependently from their parents or guardians, for example through their exclusion from \nthe family home, and will require a different level of intervention and support. Local \nauthority children’s social care will be the lead agency for these children and the \ndesignated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) should ensure appropriate referrals are made \nbased on the child’s circumstances. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and \nCommunities have published joint statutory guidance on the provision of accommodation \nfor 16- and 17-year-olds who may be homeless and/or require accommodation: here. \nMental health\nWhere children have suffered abuse and neglect, or other potentially traumatic adverse \nchildhood experiences, this can have a lasting impact throughout childhood, adolescence \nand into adulthood. It is key that staff are aware of how these children’s experiences, can \nimpact on their mental health, behaviour, attendance and progress at school.\n",

As with other safeguarding risks, staff \nshould be alert to changes in children’s behaviour, which could indicate that they may be \nin need of help or protection. Staff should use their judgement in identifying children who \nmight be at risk of radicalisation and act proportionately which may include the \ndesignated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) making a Prevent referral. \nThe Prevent duty\nAll schools and colleges are subject to a duty under section 26 of the Counter- Terrorism\nand Security Act 2015, in the exercise of their functions, to have “due regard152 to the \nneed to prevent people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism”.153 This duty is \nknown as the Prevent duty.\nThe Prevent duty should be seen as part of schools’ and colleges’ wider safeguarding \nobligations. Designated safeguarding leads (and deputies) and other senior leaders in \neducation settings should familiarise themselves with the revised Prevent duty guidance: \nfor England and Wales, especially paragraphs 141-210, which are specifically concerned \nwith education (and also covers childcare). The guidance is set out in terms of three \ngeneral themes: leadership and partnership, capabilities and reducing permissive \nenvironments.\nThe school or college’s designated safeguarding lead (and any deputies) should be \naware of local procedures for making a Prevent referral.\nChannel\nChannel is a voluntary, confidential support programme which focuses on providing \nsupport at an early stage to people who are identified as being susceptible to being \ndrawn into terrorism. Prevent referrals are assessed and may be passed to a multi\u0002agency Channel panel, which will discuss the individual referred to determine whether \nthey are at risk of being drawn into terrorism and consider the appropriate support \nrequired. A representative from the school or college may be asked to attend the \nChannel panel to help with this assessment. An individual will be required to provide their \nconsent before any support delivered through the programme is provided. \n152 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (legislation.gov.uk) \n153 “Terrorism” for these purposes has the same meaning as for the Terrorism Act 2000 (section 1(1) to (4) \nof that Act).\n",

It can also occur online. It can \nalso occur through a group of children sexually assaulting or sexually harassing a single \nchild or group of children.\nChildren who are victims of sexual violence and sexual harassment will likely find the \nexperience stressful and distressing. This will, in all likelihood, adversely affect their \neducational attainment and will be exacerbated if the alleged perpetrator(s) attends the \nsame school or college. Sexual violence and sexual harassment exist on a continuum \nand may overlap, they can occur online and face to face (both physically and verbally) \nand are never acceptable.\nIt is essential that all victims are reassured that they are being taken seriously and that \nthey will be supported and kept safe. A victim should never be given the impression that \nthey are creating a problem by reporting sexual violence or sexual harassment. Nor \nshould a victim ever be made to feel ashamed for making a report. Detailed advice is \navailable in Part five of this guidance.\nSerious violence\nThere are a number of indicators, which may signal children are at risk from, or are \ninvolved with, serious violent crime. These may include: \n• increased absence from school\n• a change in friendships or relationships with older individuals or groups\n• a significant decline in performance\n• signs of self-harm or a significant change in wellbeing, or signs of assault or \nunexplained injuries\n• unexplained gifts or new possessions could also indicate that children have been \napproached by, or are involved with, individuals associated with criminal networks \nor gangs and may be at risk of criminal exploitation.\nThe likelihood of involvement in serious violence may be increased by factors such as:\n• being male\n• having been frequently absent or permanently excluded from school\n• having experienced child maltreatment and having been involved in offending, \nsuch as theft or robbery.\nA fuller list of risk factors can be found in the Home Office’s Serious Violence Strategy.\n",

Professionals in all agencies, \nand individuals and groups in relevant communities, need to be alert to the possibility of a \nchild being at risk of HBA, or already having suffered HBA.\nActions\nIf staff have a concern regarding a child who might be at risk of HBA or who has suffered \nfrom HBA, they should speak to the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy). As \nappropriate, the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) will activate local \nsafeguarding procedures, using existing national and local protocols for multi-agency \nliaison with the police and local authority children’s social care. Where FGM has taken \nplace, since 31 October 2015 there has been a mandatory reporting duty placed on \nteachers154 that requires a different approach (see below).\nFGM comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female \ngenitalia or other injury to the female genital organs. It is illegal in the UK and a form of \nchild abuse with long-lasting harmful consequences.\nFGM mandatory reporting duty for teachers\nSection 5B of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (as inserted by section 74 of the \nSerious Crime Act 2015) places a statutory duty upon teachers, along with regulated \nhealth and social care professionals in England and Wales, to report to the police where \nthey discover (either through disclosure by the victim or visual evidence) that FGM \nappears to have been carried out on a girl under 18. Those failing to report such cases \nmay face disciplinary sanctions. It will be rare for teachers to see visual evidence, and \nthey should not be examining pupils or students, but the same definition of what is meant \nby “to discover that an act of FGM appears to have been carried out” is used for all \nprofessionals to whom this mandatory reporting duty applies. Information on when and \nhow to make a report can be found at: Mandatory reporting of female genital mutilation \nprocedural information.\nTeachers must personally report to the police cases where they discover that an act of \nFGM appears to have been carried out.155 Unless the teacher has good reason not to, \nthey should still consider and discuss any such case with the school or college’s \ndesignated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) and involve local authority children’s social \ncare as appropriate. The duty does not apply in relation to at risk or suspected cases (i.e. \n154 Under Section 5B(11)(a) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, “teacher” means, in relation to \nEngland, a person within section 141A(1) of the Education Act 2002 (persons employed or engaged to \ncarry out teaching work at schools and other institutions in England). \n155 Section 5B(6) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 states teachers need not report a case to the \npolice if they have reason to believe that another teacher has already reported the case.\n",

In these cases, teachers should follow local safeguarding \nprocedures. The following is a useful summary of the FGM mandatory reporting duty: \nFGM Fact Sheet.\nFurther information can be found in the Multi-agency statutory guidance on female genital \nmutilation and the FGM resource pack particularly section 13.\nForced marriage\nForcing a person into a marriage is a crime in England and Wales. A forced marriage is \none entered into without the full and free consent of one or both parties and where \nviolence, threats or any other form of coercion is used to cause a person to enter into a \nmarriage. Threats can be physical or emotional and psychological. A lack of full and free \nconsent can be where a person does not consent or where they cannot consent (if they \nhave learning disabilities, for example). Nevertheless, some perpetrators use perceived \ncultural practices to coerce a person into marriage. Schools and colleges can play an \nimportant role in safeguarding children from forced marriage.\nThe Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) has created: Multi-agency practice guidelines: handling \ncases of forced marriage (chapter 8 provides guidance on the role of schools and \ncolleges) and, Multi-agency statutory guidance for dealing with forced marriage, which \ncan both be found at The right to choose: government guidance on forced marriage - \nGOV.UK (www.gov.uk). School and college staff can contact the Forced Marriage Unit if \nthey need advice or information: Contact: 020 7008 0151 or email fmu@fcdo.gov.uk. \nIn addition, since February 2023 it has also been a crime to carry out any conduct whose \npurpose is to cause a child to marry before their eighteenth birthday, even if violence, \nthreats or another form of coercion are not used. As with the existing forced marriage \nlaw, this applies to non-binding, unofficial ‘marriages’ as well as legal marriages.\nAdditional advice and support\nThere is a wealth of information available to support schools and colleges. The following \nlist is not exhaustive but should provide a useful starting point:\nAbuse\nCentre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse has introduced new resources to help \neducation professionals identify and respond to concerns of child sexual abuse and \nabusive behaviours.\n",

The designated safeguarding lead should take lead responsibility for \nsafeguarding and child protection (including online safety and understanding the filtering \nand monitoring systems and processes in place). This should be explicit in the role \nholder’s job description. \nThe designated safeguarding lead should have the appropriate status and authority \nwithin the school or college to carry out the duties of the post. The role of the designated \nsafeguarding lead carries a significant level of responsibility, and they should be given \nthe additional time, funding, training, resources and support they need to carry out the \nrole effectively. Their additional responsibilities include providing advice and support to \nother staff on child welfare, safeguarding and child protection matters, taking part in \nstrategy discussions and inter-agency meetings, and/or supporting other staff to do so, \nand contributing to the assessment of children.\nDeputy designated safeguarding leads\nIt is a matter for individual schools and colleges as to whether they choose to have one \nor more deputy designated safeguarding leads. Any deputies should be trained to the \nsame standard as the designated safeguarding lead and the role should be explicit in \ntheir job description. Whilst the activities of the designated safeguarding lead can be \ndelegated to appropriately trained deputies, the ultimate lead responsibility for child \nprotection, as set out above, remains with the designated safeguarding lead, this lead \nresponsibility should not be delegated.\nAvailability\nDuring term time the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy) should always be \navailable (during school or college hours) for staff in the school or college to discuss any \nsafeguarding concerns. Whilst generally speaking the designated safeguarding lead (or a \ndeputy) would be expected to be available in person, it is a matter for individual schools \nand colleges, working with the designated safeguarding lead, to define what “available” \nmeans and whether in exceptional circumstances availability via phone and or Skype or \nother such media is acceptable. It is a matter for individual schools and colleges and the \ndesignated safeguarding lead to arrange adequate and appropriate cover arrangements \nfor any out of hours/out of term activities.\n",

This extends to considering their safety and how best to minimise \nrisk of harm to those children during any exchange visit the school or college arranges, \nand when organising the care and accommodation for a child with a host family (known \nas homestays) as part of the exchange.\nSchool/college arranged homestay – suitability of adults in UK \nhost families\nWhen arranging a homestay, schools should consider the suitability of the adults in the \nrespective families who will be responsible for the visiting child during the stay.\nIn circumstances where a school or college arrange for a visiting child to be provided with \ncare and accommodation in the UK (including where they engage a company to make \nthose arrangements) in the home of a family to which the child is not related159 the \nresponsible adults will be engaging in regulated activity for the period of the stay.160 In \nsuch cases and where the school or college has the power to terminate such a homestay \nthe school or college would be the regulated activity provider.161\nA regulated activity provider commits a criminal offence if it knows or has reason to \nbelieve that an individual is barred by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) from \nengaging in regulated activity but allows that individual to carry out any form of regulated \nactivity.162\n159 This includes where a person has parental responsibility for the visiting child.\n160 Paragraph 1(5) of Schedule 4 and Section 53 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.Where \nan adult is providing homestay in circumstances other than as described in this section, the school or \ncollege should seek advice from the DBS about whether the individual will be in regulated activity.\n161 Section 53(3) and (4) of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.\n162 Section 9 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.\n",

This guidance applies in England, Wales and Northern \nIreland. It covers settings including but not limited to schools, childcare establishments, \ncolleges, youth groups and sports clubs.\nFor too long child protection policy has been developed in haste and in response to \nindividual tragedies, with the well intentioned though misguided belief that every risk \ncould be mitigated, and every loophole closed. The pressure has been to prescribe and \nlegislate more. This has led to public confusion, a fearful workforce and a dysfunctional \nculture of mistrust between children and adults. This Government is taking a different \napproach.\nWe start with a presumption of trust and confidence in those who work with children, and \nthe good sense and judgement of their managers. This guidance applies when an \norganisation decides to supervise with the aim that the supervised work will not be \nregulated activity (when it would be, if not so supervised). In such a case, the law makes \nthree main points:\n• there must be supervision by a person who is in regulated activity iii\n• the supervision must be regular and day to day; and\n• the supervision must be “reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure the \nprotection of children”.\nThe organisation must have regard to this guidance. This gives local managers the \nflexibility to determine what is reasonable for their circumstances. While the precise \nnature and level of supervision will vary from case to case, guidance on the main legal \npoints above is as follows. \nSupervision by a person in regulated activity/regular and day to day: supervisors must be \nin regulated activity themselves iv. The duty that supervision must take place “on a \nregular basis” means that supervision must not, for example, be concentrated during the \nfirst few weeks of an activity and then tail off thereafter, becoming the exception not the \nrule. It must take place on an ongoing basis, whether the worker has just started or has \nbeen doing the activity for some time.\nReasonable in the circumstances: within the statutory duty, the level of supervision may\n",

The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes provisions for a statutory duty on an organisation \narranging regulated activity (under the 2006 Act or 2007 Order, both as amended) to check that a person \nentering regulated activity is not barred from regulated activity and a standalone barring check. These are \nyet to be commenced.\niv. A volunteer is: in England and Wales, a person who performs an activity which involves spending time, \nunpaid (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses), doing something which aims to \nbenefit someone (individuals or groups) other than or in addition to close relatives. In Northern Ireland, a \nvolunteer is: a person engaged, or to be engaged, in an activity for a non-profit organisation or person \nwhich involves spending time unpaid (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses) doing \nsomething which amounts to a benefit to some third party other than, or in addition to, a close relative.\n",
